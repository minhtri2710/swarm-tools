/**
 * Pre-built query to calculate task duration percentiles.
 *
 * Computes p50 (median), p95, and p99 durations by:
 * 1. Finding task_started and task_completed event pairs
 * 2. Calculating duration = completed_timestamp - started_timestamp
 * 3. Using ORDER BY + LIMIT to approximate percentiles
 *
 * Note: libSQL doesn't have percentile_cont, so we use row counting
 * to approximate percentiles.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const adapter = await getSwarmMailLibSQL(projectPath);
 * const db = await adapter.getDatabase();
 * const result = await db.query(taskDuration.sql);
 * ```
