# swarm-mail

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [`1e41c9b`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/1e41c9b42ae468761f813d406171d182fb9948e0) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Semantic Memory Consolidation

  > _"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."_
  > — Leonardo da Vinci

  The semantic memory system has moved into swarm-mail, bringing persistent learning to the hive.

  ### What's New

  **Semantic Memory in swarm-mail:**

  - `createSemanticMemory()` - Initialize memory store with PGLite + Ollama embeddings
  - `getMigrationStatus()` - Check if legacy memory needs migration
  - `migrateLegacyMemory()` - Migrate from old semantic-memory-mcp format
  - Automatic migration on first use (no manual intervention needed)

  **Legacy Migration:**

  - Detects old `~/.semantic-memory/` databases
  - Migrates memories, embeddings, and metadata
  - Preserves all tags and timestamps
  - Creates backup before migration

  **Worker Handoff Protocol:**

  - Agents can now hand off work mid-task
  - State preserved via swarm mail messages
  - Enables long-running tasks across context limits

  ### Breaking Changes

  None - this is additive. The old semantic-memory-mcp still works but is deprecated.

  ### Files Added/Changed

  - `packages/swarm-mail/src/memory/` - New memory subsystem
  - `packages/swarm-mail/src/memory/migrate-legacy.ts` - Migration tooling
  - `packages/opencode-swarm-plugin/bin/swarm.ts` - Uses new exports

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [`a2ff1f4`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/a2ff1f4257a2e9857f63abe4e9b941a573f44380) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Cell IDs Now Wear Their Project Colors

  > _"We may fantasize about being International Men of Mystery, but our code needs to be mundane and clear. One of the most important parts of clear code is good names."_
  > — Martin Fowler, _Refactoring_

  Cell IDs finally know where they came from. Instead of anonymous `bd-xxx` prefixes,
  new cells proudly display their project name: `swarm-mail-lf2p4u-abc123`.

  ### What Changed

  **swarm-mail:**

  - `generateBeadId()` now reads `package.json` name field from project directory
  - Added `slugifyProjectName()` for safe ID generation (lowercase, special chars → dashes)
  - Falls back to `cell-` prefix if no package.json or no name field

  **opencode-swarm-plugin:**

  - Removed all `bd` CLI usage from `swarm-orchestrate.ts` - now uses HiveAdapter
  - Improved compaction hook swarm detection with confidence levels (high/medium/low)
  - Added fallback detection prompt for uncertain swarm states

  ### Examples

  | Before                  | After                           |
  | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
  | `bd-lf2p4u-mjbneh7mqah` | `swarm-mail-lf2p4u-mjbneh7mqah` |
  | `bd-abc123-xyz`         | `my-cool-app-abc123-xyz`        |
  | (no package.json)       | `cell-abc123-xyz`               |

  ### Why It Matters

  - **Identifiable at a glance** - Know which project a cell belongs to without looking it up
  - **Multi-project workspaces** - Filter/search cells by project prefix
  - **Terminology cleanup** - Removes legacy "bead" (`bd-`) from user-facing IDs

  ### Backward Compatible

  Existing `bd-*` IDs still work fine. No migration needed - only NEW cells get project prefixes.

  ### Compaction: Keeping the Swarm Alive

  > _"Intelligent and structured group dynamics that emerge not from a leader, but from the local interactions of the elements themselves."_
  > — Daniel Shiffman, _The Nature of Code_

  The compaction hook now uses multi-signal detection to keep swarms cooking through context compression:

  - **HIGH confidence:** Active reservations, in_progress cells → full swarm context
  - **MEDIUM confidence:** Open subtasks, unclosed epics → full swarm context
  - **LOW confidence:** Any cells exist → fallback detection prompt

  Philosophy: Err on the side of continuation. A false positive costs context space. A false negative loses the swarm.

  - Fix migration version collision: beadsMigration now v7, cellsViewMigration now v8 (was conflicting with streams v6)
  - Add `checkBeadsMigrationNeeded()` to detect legacy .beads directories
  - Add `migrateBeadsToHive()` to rename .beads to .hive
  - Add `ensureHiveDirectory()` to create .hive if missing (called by hive_sync)

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [`50a2bf5`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/50a2bf51c5320c038f202191d7acbfd2179f2cb3) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Fix cells view migration not being applied

  The v7 migration (cellsViewMigration) that creates the `cells` view was added after
  swarm-mail@0.3.0 was published. This caused `hive_sync` to fail with
  "relation cells does not exist" because the JSONL export queries the `cells` view.

  This patch ensures the v7 migration is included in the published package.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`26fd2ef`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/26fd2ef27562edc39f7db7a9cdbed399a465200d) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Rename beads → hive across the codebase

  - `createBeadsAdapter` → `createHiveAdapter` (old name still exported as alias)
  - `BeadsAdapter` type → `HiveAdapter` type
  - All internal references updated to use hive terminology
  - Backward compatible: old exports still work but are deprecated

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [`b2d4a84`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/b2d4a84748cdef4b9dbca7666dd3d313b6cd2b24) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Add automatic JSONL migration for beads on first use

  - Auto-migrate from `.beads/issues.jsonl` when database is empty

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`1a7b02f`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/1a7b02f707a1490f14465467c6024331d5064878) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Add PGLite socket server adapter with hybrid daemon management and move streams storage to $TMPDIR.

  **Socket Server Adapter:**

  - New `createSocketAdapter()` wrapping postgres.js for DatabaseAdapter interface
  - Daemon lifecycle: `startDaemon()`, `stopDaemon()`, `isDaemonRunning()`, `healthCheck()`
  - Auto-start daemon on first use with `SWARM_MAIL_SOCKET=true` env var
  - Graceful fallback to embedded PGLite on failure
  - CLI: `swarm-mail-daemon start|stop|status`

  **$TMPDIR Storage (BREAKING):**

  - Streams now stored in `$TMPDIR/opencode-<project-name>-<hash>/streams`
  - Eliminates git pollution from `.opencode/streams/`
  - Auto-cleaned on reboot (ephemeral coordination state)
  - New exports: `getProjectTempDirName()`, `hashProjectPath()`

  This fixes the multi-agent PGLite corruption issue by having all agents connect to a single pglite-server daemon via PostgreSQL wire protocol.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [`7471fd4`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/7471fd43ef9b16b32e503d7cd4bdc5b7a74537e4) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Fix swarm_complete tool execution failures and remove debug logging

  **opencode-swarm-plugin:**

  - Fix: Made sendSwarmMessage non-fatal in swarm_complete - failures no longer cause "Tool execution failed" errors
  - Fix: Added message_sent and message_error fields to swarm_complete response for better error visibility
  - Chore: Removed console.log statements from index.ts, swarm-orchestrate.ts, storage.ts, rate-limiter.ts
  - Test: Added integration tests for swarm_complete error handling

  **swarm-mail:**

  - Chore: Cleaned up debug logging and improved migration handling

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [`22befbf`](https://github.com/joelhooks/opencode-swarm-plugin/commit/22befbfa120a37a585cfec0709597172efda92a4) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - fix: mark @electric-sql/pglite as external in build to fix WASM file resolution

  PGLite requires its WASM data file (pglite.data) at runtime. When bundled into swarm-mail, the path resolution broke because it looked for the file relative to the bundle location instead of the installed @electric-sql/pglite package location.

  This caused "ENOENT: no such file or directory" errors when initializing the database.
