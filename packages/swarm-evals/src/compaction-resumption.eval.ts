/**
 * Compaction Hook Coordinator Resumption Eval
 *
 * Tests that the compaction hook correctly detects swarm state and injects
 * appropriate context for coordinator resumption.
 *
 * ## Bug Being Tested
 *
 * Root cause: The compaction hook injects generic "you are a coordinator"
 * context but doesn't include the SPECIFIC epic ID, subtask status, or
 * project path. This causes coordinators to lose identity after compaction.
 *
 * ## Test Cases
 *
 * 1. Active swarm with in_progress epic - should inject full context with epic ID
 * 2. Multiple epics - should identify the in_progress one
 * 3. No active swarm - should not inject coordinator context
 * 4. Blocked epic - should still detect as active swarm
 *
 * Run with: pnpm eval:dev (watch mode) or pnpm eval:run (once)

You are the **COORDINATOR** of an active swarm. Context was compacted but the swarm is still running.

**YOUR JOB:** Keep orchestrating. Spawn agents. Monitor progress. Unblock work. Ship it.

### On Resume - IMMEDIATELY

1. \`swarm_status(epic_id="<epic>", project_key="<path>")\` - Get current state
2. \`swarmmail_inbox(limit=5)\` - Check for agent messages
3. \`swarm_review(project_key, epic_id, task_id, files_touched)\` - Review any completed work
4. **Spawn ready subtasks** - Don't wait, fire them off

### Keep the Swarm Cooking

- **Spawn aggressively** - If a subtask is ready and unblocked, spawn an agent
- **Monitor actively** - Check status, read messages, respond to blockers
- **Close the loop** - When all subtasks done, verify and close the epic

**You are not waiting for instructions. You are the coordinator. Coordinate.**

const SWARM_DETECTION_FALLBACK = `## 🐝 Swarm Detection - Check Your Context

**IMPORTANT:** Before summarizing, check if this session involves an active swarm.

Look for ANY of these patterns in the conversation:

### Tool Calls (definite swarm sign)
- \`swarm_decompose\`, \`swarm_spawn_subtask\`, \`swarm_status\`, \`swarm_complete\`
- \`swarmmail_init\`, \`swarmmail_reserve\`, \`swarmmail_send\`
- \`hive_create_epic\`, \`hive_start\`, \`hive_close\`

### If You Find Swarm Evidence

Include this in your summary and tell the resumed session:
"This is an active swarm. Check swarm_status and swarmmail_inbox immediately."
