Unlike simple event listeners, this is a **multi-phase, composable hook architecture** with optional callbacks and dependency injection.\n\n## Complete Hook Inventory\n1. **Compaction Hooks** (3):\n   - `anthropic-auto-compact`: Detects Anthropic token limit errors, auto-triggers compaction with retry logic\n   - `preemptive-compaction`: Proactive compaction at 80% context threshold (configurable), prevents overflow\n   - `compaction-context-injector`: Injects structured prompt before summarization to preserve user requests, goals, completed work, remaining tasks, and \"MUST NOT do\" constraints\n\n2. **Session Recovery Hooks** (2):\n   - `session-recovery`: Repairs 3 error types (tool_result_missing, thinking_block_order, thinking_disabled_violation) by manipulating session filesystem\n   - `session-notification`: Tracks session state, prevents double notifications\n\n3. **Think Mode Hooks** (1):\n   - `think-mode`: Keyword detection (\"think\", \"ultrathink\"), auto-switches to high-variant model (e.g., sonnet-4-5 → sonnet-4.5-high), injects thinking config\n\n4. **Claude Code Compatibility Hooks** (5 event types):\n   - `claude-code-hooks`: Full compatibility layer for Claude Code hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, PreCompact)\n   - Executes external hook commands via stdin/stdout protocol\n   - Pattern matching with glob/regex matchers\n   - JSON-based hook configuration from `.claude/settings.json`\n\n5. **Context Management** (3):\n   - `context-window-monitor`: Injects reminder at 70% usage (Anthropic models)\n   - `tool-output-truncator`: Aggressive truncation with experimental mode\n   - `empty-message-sanitizer`: Fixes empty message parts\n\n6. **Directory Injection** (2):\n   - `directory-agents-injector`: Auto-injects AGENTS.md from current/parent dirs\n   - `directory-readme-injector`: Auto-injects README.md\n\n7. **Task Enforcement** (3):\n   - `todo-continuation-enforcer`: Forces agent to continue if quits mid-task (Sisyphus pattern)\n   - `empty-task-response-detector`: Detects and blocks empty task tool responses\n   - `agent-usage-reminder`: Reminds to use specialized agents\n\n8. **Other** (2):\n   - `rules-injector`: Injects RULES.md files\n   - `comment-checker`: Prevents excessive AI comments\n   - `keyword-detector`: Detects special keywords\n   - `non-interactive-env`: Sets non-interactive env vars\n   - `interactive-bash-session`: Tmux session management\n   - `background-notification`: Notifies on background task completion\n   - `auto-update-checker`: Version checking + toast\n\n## Hook Registration Architecture\n**Pattern:** Factory functions return hook objects with method keys matching OpenCode lifecycle events.\n\n```typescript\nfunction createMyHook(ctx: PluginInput, options?: MyOptions) {\n  return {\n    \"chat.message\": async (input, output) => { /* modify output */ },\n    \"chat.params\": async (output, sessionID) => { /* modify params */ },\n    \"tool.execute.before\": async (input, output) => { /* modify args */ },\n    \"tool.execute.after\": async (input, output) => { /* modify results */ },\n    \"event\": async ({ event }) => { /* handle lifecycle events */ },\n    \"experimental.session.compacting\": async (input, output) => { /* inject context */ }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Hook Execution Flow\n1. **Plugin loads** → All hooks instantiated with `isHookEnabled()` guard\n2. **Main plugin returns** → Aggregates hook methods into plugin object\n3. **OpenCode calls lifecycle methods** → Plugin dispatches to all enabled hooks\n4. **Hooks execute serially** → `await hook1(); await hook2(); ...`\n5. **No short-circuiting** → All hooks run unless one throws\n\n## Event Types (Lifecycle)\n- `session.created` → New session started\n- `session.deleted` → Session closed (cleanup trigger)\n- `session.idle` → Agent stopped responding\n- `session.error` → Error occurred (recovery trigger)\n- `session.updated` → Session metadata changed\n- `message.created` → New message added\n- `message.updated` → Message modified (streaming updates)\n\n## Hook Ordering Strategy\n**No explicit ordering** - hooks registered in code order, all run serially. Coordination via:\n- **Shared state**: Maps/Sets per sessionID\n- **Callbacks**: `setOnAbortCallback()`, `setOnRecoveryCompleteCallback()`\n- **Conditional execution**: Guards like `if (compactionInProgress.has(sessionID)) return`\n\n## Error Handling Patterns\n1. **Silent degradation**: Most hooks catch errors, don't throw (preserve user experience)\n2. **Graceful fallbacks**: Multiple recovery strategies in sequence\n3. **State cleanup**: `session.deleted` event triggers Map/Set cleanup\n4. **Retry logic**: `anthropic-auto-compact` has 3 retry attempts with different strategies\n\n## Novel Patterns for Swarm\n1. **Compaction Context Injection**: Structured prompt before summarization prevents loss of critical context (user requests, constraints, completed work, remaining tasks)\n2. **Callback-based hook coordination**: Hooks expose callbacks for cross-hook coordination without tight coupling\n3. **Filesystem-based session recovery**: Manipulates OpenCode's session storage files to repair broken states\n4. **Preemptive compaction**: Token usage monitoring → trigger compaction before overflow (80% threshold)\n5. **Hook message injection**: Injects system messages into session without going through chat API (filesystem write)\n6. **External hook protocol**: stdin/stdout protocol for user-defined hooks (Claude Code compatibility)\n7. **Think mode auto-switching**: Keyword detection → model variant upgrade + config injection\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- **Composability over inheritance**: Each hook is self-contained, opt-in via config\n- **Filesystem as IPC**: Session state manipulation via direct file writes\n- **Event-driven cleanup**: `session.deleted` as universal cleanup signal\n- **Progressive enhancement**: Hooks add features without breaking core functionality\n- **Context preservation through compaction**: Structured prompts ensure continuity after summarization","created_at":"1766673445032.0","tags":"oh-my-opencode,hooks,lifecycle,research,opencode,plugin-architecture"}

ROOT CAUSE: Filter is correctly designed but TOO STRICT for real-world data.\n\nDATA BREAKDOWN:\n- 70 sessions (68.6%) = single-event worker completions (NOT coordinator sessions, should be excluded)\n- 20 sessions (19.6%) = no worker_spawned event (incomplete coordinator sessions)\n- 9 sessions (8.8%) = spawned workers but no reviews captured\n- 3 sessions (2.9%) = PASS (gold-standard: 20-24 worker spawns, 4-13 reviews, 6-9 hours duration, zero violations)\n\nFILTER IS WORKING AS DESIGNED: Correctly isolates high-quality complete coordinator cycles for evaluation.\n\nPROBLEM: 2.9% passing rate means most coordinator behavior is invisible to evals.\n\nSOLUTION: Change defaults to requireWorkerSpawn=false, requireReview=false. This increases passing to ~28 sessions (27.5%) while still filtering out worker-only noise. Users can opt-in to stricter filters for gold-standard analysis.\n\nADDITIONAL FINDINGS:\n- No decomposition_complete events in ANY session (including the 3 passing)\n- Some sessions have 22 review_completed with no worker_spawned (split sessions?)\n- Session capture may split long-running coordinators across multiple files\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Loosen default filter criteria (immediate)\n2. Add isCoordinatorSession() filter to exclude worker-only sessions\n3. Investigate session splitting behavior in eval-capture.ts\n4.

This caused schema conflicts - old schema from previous tests was reused.\n\n**Root Cause:** `getDatabasePath()` logic was:\n```typescript\nif (projectPath) {\n  const localDir = join(projectPath, \".opencode\");\n  if (existsSync(localDir) || existsSync(projectPath)) {\n    // create local DB\n  }\n}\n// fallback to global\n```\n\nWhen `projectPath` didn't exist (e.g., `/tmp/test-swarm-12345` not created yet), the `existsSync(projectPath)` check failed, so it fell back to global DB. Tests never created the projectPath directory, assuming getDatabasePath would handle it.\n\n**Solution:** Create `projectPath` directory in `getDatabasePath()` before checking:\n```typescript\nif (projectPath) {\n  const localDir = join(projectPath, \".opencode\");\n  // Create project directory if it doesn't exist\n  if (!existsSync(projectPath)) {\n    mkdirSync(projectPath, { recursive: true });\n  }\n  if (!existsSync(localDir)) {\n    mkdirSync(localDir, { recursive: true });\n  }\n  return join(localDir, \"streams\");\n}\n```\n\n**Impact:** Now each test gets an isolated database at `projectPath/.opencode/streams`, preventing schema pollution between tests.\n\n**Files Changed:**\n- `streams/index.ts`: Fixed `getDatabasePath()` to create directories\n\n**Lesson:** When database path depends on a directory, create it unconditionally.

SwarmMailAdapter doesn't expose `.db` property - it has `getDatabase()` method instead.\n\n**Key design decision:** Subscribe polls every 100ms instead of using database triggers.

Extracts `files_touched` from `task_completed` events. Useful for detecting agents modifying files they weren't assigned.\n\n2. **task-duration**: p50/p95/p99 task durations. Uses window functions (ROW_NUMBER, COUNT OVER) to approximate percentiles since libSQL lacks `percentile_cont`. Joins `task_started` and `task_completed` events to calculate duration.\n\n3. **checkpoint-frequency**: Checkpoint creation frequency per agent. Counts `checkpoint_created` events, calculates avg interval between checkpoints using `(MAX - MIN) / NULLIF(COUNT - 1, 0)` pattern.\n\n4. **recovery-success**: Deferred task resolution success rate.

This manifests as:\n- 'PGlite is closed' errors\n- Missing data after writes\n- Inconsistent query results\n- Database file corruption requiring deletion\n\nSOLUTION: Implement PGLite leader election pattern from multi-tab-worker docs (https://pglite.dev/docs/multi-tab-worker).\n\nThe pattern works by:\n1. Each worker/agent creates a PGliteWorker instead of PGlite directly\n2. Workers run an election to nominate ONE as the leader\n3. ONLY the leader starts the actual PGlite instance\n4. All other workers proxy their queries through the leader\n5.

Direct Subagent Invocation\n- All agents have `mode: \"subagent\"` (except Sisyphus which can be default)\n- Sisyphus delegates via standard OpenCode `task()` tool\n- Tool restrictions enforced: `{ write: false, edit: false, background_task: false }` for most\n- Model-aware config: GPT models get `reasoningEffort`, Claude gets `thinking` budget\n\n### 2. Background Task System (`BackgroundManager`)\nLocated in `src/features/background-agent/manager.ts`:\n\n**Key Innovation**: Async agent execution with lifecycle tracking\n\n```typescript\nclass BackgroundManager {\n  async launch(input: LaunchInput): Promise<BackgroundTask>\n  handleEvent(event: Event): void  // Listens to session events\n  markForNotification(task: BackgroundTask): void\n  getPendingNotifications(sessionID: string): BackgroundTask[]\n}\n```\n\n**Lifecycle**:\n1. Create child session with `parentID` linkage\n2. Launch agent via `session.promptAsync()` (non-blocking)\n3. Track via `subagentSessions` global set\n4. Poll session status every 2s for completion\n5. Check for incomplete todos before marking complete\n6. Send notification to parent session + show toast\n7. Results retrieved via `background_output(task_id)`\n\n**Novel Features**:\n- Progress tracking: counts tool calls, tracks last tool/message\n- Todo-aware completion: waits for todo-continuation hook before completing\n- Parent session notification: injects message into parent thread\n- Toast notifications via OpenCode TUI client\n- Session deletion handling (marks as cancelled)\n\n### 3. call_omo_agent Tool\nCustom tool in `src/tools/call-omo-agent/`:\n- Wraps background_task for explore/librarian only\n- Enforces `ALLOWED_AGENTS = [\"explore\", \"librarian\"]` \n- Supports both sync (`run_in_background=false`) and async modes\n- Sync mode allows session continuation via `session_id` param\n- Async mode returns task_id for later retrieval\n\n## Inter-Agent Communication\n\n### Coordinator → Worker Pattern\n\n**Sisyphus** (orchestrator) uses structured delegation prompts (7 sections):\n1. TASK: Atomic goal\n2. EXPECTED OUTCOME: Success criteria\n3. REQUIRED SKILLS: Skill to invoke\n4. REQUIRED TOOLS: Explicit whitelist\n5. MUST DO: Exhaustive requirements\n6. MUST NOT DO: Forbidden actions\n7. CONTEXT: File paths, patterns, constraints\n\n**Post-delegation verification** (enforced in Sisyphus prompt):\n- Does it work as expected?\n- Did it follow codebase patterns?\n- Expected result achieved?\n- Did agent follow MUST DO/MUST NOT DO?\n\n### Parallel Execution Philosophy\n\n**explore** and **librarian** treated as \"grep, not consultants\":\n- Always launched in parallel via `background_task()`\n- Never wait synchronously\n- Collect results with `background_output()` when needed\n- Mandatory minimum parallel calls: 3+ (TYPE A), 4+ (TYPE B/C), 6+ (TYPE D)\n\n### Tool Restrictions by Agent\n\n- **oracle**: Read-only (`write: false, edit: false, task: false, background_task: false`)\n- **librarian**: Read-only + external search tools\n- **explore**: Read-only + codebase search tools\n- **frontend-ui-ux-engineer**: Can edit but no background_task\n- **multimodal-looker**: Limited tools (`task: false, call_omo_agent: false, look_at: false`)\n\n## Novel Coordination Patterns We Could Adopt\n\n### 1. Factory-Based Agent Registry\n**What**: Agents defined as factory functions, not static configs\n**Why**: Enables model-specific configuration, dynamic prompt injection\n**Adopt for**: Our agent definitions could accept model param and return different configs (e.g., Haiku vs Opus workers get different thinking budgets)\n\n### 2. Environment Context Injection\n**What**: Auto-inject date/timezone/platform into agent prompts\n**Why**: Prevents agents from hallucinating dates, knowing context\n**Adopt for**: Coordinator and researcher agents in our swarm\n\n### 3. Background Task Manager with Lifecycle Tracking\n**What**: Centralized manager tracking async agent execution with events\n**Why**: Real-time progress visibility, todo-aware completion, parent notification\n**Adopt for**: Our swarm orchestration - track worker progress, notify coordinator\n\n### 4. Todo-Aware Completion\n**What**: Don't mark agent complete until all todos are done\n**Why**: Prevents premature completion, enforces task completion\n**Adopt for**: Worker agents in swarm - integrate with hive cells\n\n### 5. Parallel Execution Minimums\n**What**: Enforce minimum parallel tool calls (3+, 4+, 6+) by request type\n**Why**: Prevents sequential bottlenecks, maximizes throughput\n**Adopt for**: Researcher agents - force parallel doc lookups\n\n### 6. Delegation Verification Protocol\n**What**: 7-section delegation prompt + post-work verification checklist\n**Why**: Reduces rogue agent behavior, ensures quality\n**Adopt for**: Our coordinator → worker handoff\n\n### 7. Agent-Specific Tool Whitelisting\n**What**: Each agent has explicit tool restrictions in config\n**Why**: Enforces separation of concerns, prevents tool sprawl\n**Adopt for**: Read-only agents (archaeologist, reviewer, researcher)\n\n### 8. Model-Aware Configuration\n**What**: Factory detects model type (GPT vs Claude) and sets appropriate reasoning config\n**Why**: Maximizes each model's capabilities (reasoningEffort for GPT, thinking for Claude)\n**Adopt for**: Our multi-model swarm workers\n\n### 9. Parent Session Notification System\n**What**: Background tasks inject completion messages into parent session\n**Why**: Coordinator sees worker completion inline, doesn't poll\n**Adopt for**: Swarm mail could adopt this for completion notifications\n\n### 10. Prompt Append Override\n**What**: Config allows `prompt_append` to extend (not replace) base prompt\n**Why**: Users customize without losing base instructions\n**Adopt for**: User-configurable agent overrides in swarm\n\n## Key Differences from Our Swarm\n\n| Feature | oh-my-opencode | Our Swarm |\n|---------|---------------|-----------|\n| **Coordination** | Single orchestrator (Sisyphus) | Coordinator + workers in cells |\n| **Persistence** | Session-based (ephemeral) | Hive cells (git-backed) |\n| **Communication** | Background manager events | Swarm Mail (event log) |\n| **Isolation** | Session sandboxing | Worktrees or file reservations |\n| **Learning** | None (stateless) | Pattern maturity, outcome tracking |\n| **Failure Recovery** | 3-strike rule → Oracle consult | 3-strike rule → escalate |\n| **Parallel Strategy** | Mandatory minimums (3+, 4+, 6+) | Automatic by file/feature/risk |\n| **Agent Registry** | Factory-based with deep merge | Static imports (could improve) |\n| **Tool Restrictions** | Per-agent whitelist in config | Mode-based (read-only agents) |\n| **Progress Tracking** | Tool call counting + polling | Hive cell status + swarm mail |\n\n## Actionable Takeaways for Swarm\n\n1. **Adopt factory pattern for agents** - enables model-specific configs\n2. **Add environment context injection** - prevent date hallucinations\n3. **Implement lifecycle tracking in swarm orchestrator** - track worker progress\n4. **Enforce parallel execution minimums** - researcher must launch 3+ lookups\n5. **Use 7-section delegation prompt template** - reduce rogue behavior\n6. **Add model-aware configuration** - GPT vs Claude workers get optimal settings\n7. **Consider parent notification system** - workers inject completion into coordinator thread\n8. **Explicit tool whitelisting per agent** - enforce separation of concerns\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**File Locations**:\n- Agent definitions: `src/agents/*.ts`\n- Agent registry: `src/agents/index.ts`, `src/agents/utils.ts`\n- Background manager: `src/features/background-agent/manager.ts`\n- call_omo_agent tool: `src/tools/call-omo-agent/tools.ts`\n- Plugin registration: `src/index.ts` (lines 371-450)\n\n**Key Functions**:\n- `createBuiltinAgents()`: Composes agent registry with overrides\n- `BackgroundManager.launch()`: Async agent execution\n- `BackgroundManager.handleEvent()`: Lifecycle event processing\n- `createCallOmoAgent()`: Background task wrapper tool\n\n**Dependencies**: @opencode-ai/sdk, @opencode-ai/plugin","created_at":"1766673479006.0","tags":"oh-my-opencode,agent-architecture,research,coordination-patterns,background-tasks,delegation,factories"}

When cursors table changed from `stream_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY` (PGLite) to `stream TEXT + checkpoint TEXT` (libSQL), the migration added new columns but left the old `stream_id` column in place.\n\n**Root Cause:** Drizzle's `validateSchema()` checks for missing columns and type mismatches, but doesn't detect \"extra\" columns that should have been removed. When old schema has `stream_id` and new schema has `stream`, validation says \"`stream` is missing\" but doesn't say \"`stream_id` is extra\".\n\n**Solution Pattern:**\n1. Add special-case detection BEFORE standard validation\n2. Check for old column names that indicate legacy schema\n3.

The architecture changed to coordinator-driven retry pattern where workers are considered \"dead\" after review rejection. The fix was NOT adapter caching (already fixed) but updating test expectations to match the current behavior:\n\n**Current Architecture (Coordinator-Driven Retry):**\n1. `approved` status → sendSwarmMessage to worker (worker can swarm_complete)\n2. `needs_changes` status → NO message sent, return retry_context for coordinator to use with swarm_spawn_retry\n3. After 3 rejections → task marked blocked, NO message sent, coordinator escalates\n\n**Why \"worker is dead\":**\n- Failure indicates architectural problem, not \"try harder\"\n- Coordinator needs full context to decide: retry with same agent? Different agent? Decompose differently?\n- Worker self-retry via messages couples retry logic to worker, making iteration impossible\n\n**Test Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// For needs_changes, expect NO messages\nconst messages = await swarmMail.getInbox(projectPath, \"worker\");\nexpect(messages.length).toBe(0);\n\n// Instead expect retry_context\nexpect(feedbackParsed.retry_context).toBeDefined();\nexpect(feedbackParsed.retry_context.next_action).toContain(\"swarm_spawn_retry\");\n```\n\n**Code Comments:**\nLines 595 and 613 in swarm-review.ts explicitly state \"NO sendSwarmMessage for needs_changes - worker is dead\"\n\n**Lesson:** When tests fail, check if the test expectations are stale, not just the implementation.","created_at":"1766618369821.0","metadata":"{\"files\":[\"packages/opencode-swarm-plugin/src/swarm-review.integration.test.ts\",\"packages/opencode-swarm-plugin/src/swarm-review.ts\"],\"pattern\":\"test-expectations-stale\"}","tags":"swarm-review,integration-tests,coordinator-driven-retry,architecture-change,worker-is-dead"}

Truncate large tool outputs (experimental mode)\n2. Trigger compaction via `session.summarize()` API\n3. Inject \"Continue\" after successful compaction\n**State Management:** Uses Maps for pending compactions, retry counts, fallback states\n\n## Session Recovery Hook Implementation\n\n### Session Recovery Hook\n**File:** `src/hooks/session-recovery/index.ts`\n**Error Types Handled:**\n1. `tool_result_missing`: Agent called tool, user pressed ESC before result → injects placeholder tool_result parts\n2. `thinking_block_order`: Thinking part not first in message → reorders parts in session storage\n3. `thinking_disabled_violation`: Thinking parts present when model doesn't support → strips thinking parts\n\n**Filesystem Manipulation Functions:**\n- `readParts(messageID)`: Reads `.opencode/sessions/<sessionID>/<messageID>.json`\n- `prependThinkingPart(sessionID, messageID)`: Reorders JSON parts array\n- `stripThinkingParts(messageID)`: Removes thinking parts from message\n- `injectTextPart(sessionID, messageID, text)`: Adds text part to message\n\n**Key Pattern:** Direct session file manipulation as recovery mechanism (not API-based)\n\n## Think Mode Hook Implementation\n\n### Think Mode Hook\n**File:** `src/hooks/think-mode/index.ts`\n**Hook Point:** `chat.params` (modifies message params before sending to LLM)\n**Keyword Detection:** Regex patterns for \"think\", \"ultrathink\", \"think hard\", \"think harder\"\n**Model Switching:**\n```typescript\nconst modelMap = {\n  \"claude-sonnet-4-5\": \"claude-sonnet-4.5-high\",\n  \"claude-opus-4\": \"claude-opus-4-high\"\n}\n```\n**Thinking Config Injection:** \n```typescript\noutput.message.thinking = { type: \"enabled\", budget_tokens: 10000 }\n```\n**State Tracking:** Per-session Map tracks if model was switched (for metrics/debugging)\n\n## Hook Registration Pattern\n\n### Main Plugin Registration\n**File:** `src/index.ts` lines 230-294\n**Pattern:**\n```typescript\nconst myHook = isHookEnabled(\"my-hook-name\")\n  ? createMyHook(ctx, { experimental: config.experimental })\n  : null;\n```\n**Aggregation:** Plugin returns object with hook methods calling all enabled hooks:\n```typescript\nreturn {\n  \"tool.execute.before\": async (input, output) => {\n    await hook1?.[\"tool.execute.before\"](input, output);\n    await hook2?.[\"tool.execute.before\"](input, output);\n    await hook3?.[\"tool.execute.before\"](input, output);\n  },\n  event: async (input) => {\n    await hook1?.event(input);\n    await hook2?.event(input);\n    // ... etc\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Claude Code Hooks Compatibility Layer\n\n### External Hook Protocol\n**File:** `src/hooks/claude-code-hooks/`\n**Config Location:** `~/.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.json`\n**Hook Events:** PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, PreCompact\n**Execution Pattern:**\n1. Load config with glob/regex matchers\n2. Match tool name against patterns\n3. Execute hook command via `executeHookCommand(command, stdin, cwd)`\n4. Parse JSON stdout for decision (allow/deny/ask) and modifications\n\n**stdin Protocol:**\n```json\n{\n  \"hook_event_name\": \"PreToolUse\",\n  \"tool_name\": \"bash\",\n  \"tool_input\": { \"command\": \"ls\" },\n  \"tool_use_id\": \"call_xyz\",\n  \"cwd\": \"/path/to/project\",\n  \"hook_source\": \"opencode-plugin\"\n}\n```\n\n**stdout Expected:**\n```json\n{\n  \"hookSpecificOutput\": {\n    \"permissionDecision\": \"allow|deny|ask\",\n    \"permissionDecisionReason\": \"reason\",\n    \"updatedInput\": { /* modified args */ }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Hook Message Injection Pattern\n\n### Filesystem-based Message Injection\n**File:** `src/features/hook-message-injector/`\n**Used By:** Compaction context injector, directory injectors, rules injector\n**Pattern:**\n1. Find nearest message file in session storage with required fields (agent, model)\n2. Read existing message JSON\n3. Append new text part to parts array\n4. Write back to filesystem\n5. OpenCode picks up changes on next message fetch\n\n**Why filesystem vs API?** Avoids triggering streaming events, allows injection without user-visible message in chat UI.\n\n## Key Implementation Insights\n\n1. **Hooks are stateful:** Most maintain per-session Maps/Sets for tracking\n2. **Error handling is optimistic:** Catch and log, don't throw (preserve UX)\n3. **Cleanup is event-driven:** `session.deleted` event triggers all state cleanup\n4. **Coordination via callbacks:** Hooks expose setters for cross-hook coordination\n5. **Filesystem as IPC:** Session manipulation bypasses OpenCode API for fine-grained control","created_at":"1766673490336.0","tags":"oh-my-opencode,implementation,hooks,code-patterns,opencode"}

Only 5 legitimate production memories remained.\n\nWHY IT HAPPENED:\n1. Tests wrote to shared MCP server - no test/prod isolation\n2. No collection naming convention - tests used arbitrary names\n3. No cleanup hooks in test teardown - pollution accumulated\n4. MCP server lacks delete/remove API - no automated cleanup possible\n\nIMPACT:\n- semantic-memory_find returns 86% test noise\n- Production knowledge base unreliable for semantic search\n- Wasted storage and embedding generation costs\n- Developers lose trust in knowledge base accuracy\n\nPREVENTION IMPLEMENTED (Dec 2025 via opencode-swarm-plugin-7x3pk):\n1. ✅ Subtask 1: Collection prefix isolation - test-*, temp-* reserved for tests\n2. ✅ Subtask 2: Cleanup hooks - afterEach() deletes test collections\n3. ✅ Subtask 3: Added mock semantic-memory for unit tests (avoid MCP)\n4. ✅ Subtask 5: Cleanup script at scripts/cleanup-test-memories.ts\n\nMANUAL CLEANUP REQUIRED:\nsemantic-memory MCP lacks delete API. Must use direct PostgreSQL access:\n```\npsql -h /Users/joel/.semantic-memory/memory -c \"DELETE FROM memories WHERE collection IN ('test-patterns', 'test-feedback');\"\n```\n\nFUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Request delete/remove tool from @opencode/semantic-memory maintainers\n- Add CI check: fail if test collections found in production\n- Document production collection naming: 'default' for general, domain-specific for specialized\n\nVERIFICATION:\nAfter manual cleanup, verify with semantic-memory_list - should show ~5 memories, all in 'default' collection.","created_at":"2025-12-14T22:39:53.177Z"}

Use background_output with task_id=bg_xyz to get results.\n   - Uses client.session.prompt() to inject notification into parent conversation\n   - Also shows OS toast notification via client.tui.showToast()\n   - 200ms delay before notification to ensure session state stability\n\n5. **Progress Tracking**:\n   - Monitors message.part.updated events for tool calls\n   - Polls client.session.messages() to extract: tool call count, last tool used, last message text plus timestamp\n   - Exposes via background_output status view\n\n6. **Error Handling**:\n   - promptAsync errors caught, task marked error, error stored\n   - Special case: agent.name undefined becomes friendly Agent not found message\n   - Session deletion marks task cancelled, cleans up notifications\n\n7. **Cancellation**:\n   - background_cancel(taskId) or background_cancel(all=true)\n   - Calls client.session.abort() fire-and-forget (await would abort parent too!)\n   - Marks task cancelled, sets completedAt\n\n**Novel Patterns for Swarm**:\n\n- Event-driven plus polling hybrid: More reliable than polling alone, faster than events alone\n- Todo-aware completion: Prevents completing while agent still has work queued\n- Fire-and-forget abort: Critical insight - awaiting abort() kills parent session\n- Progressive status fetching: Start with lightweight status, only fetch full messages on demand\n- Parent model inheritance: Background tasks inherit parent model config for consistency\n- Recursive task tracking: getAllDescendantTasks() walks tree of background tasks spawned by background tasks\n\n**Key Differences from Swarm**:\n- Uses OpenCode session API, not separate process spawn\n- No file reservations (oh-my-opencode does not have parallel file edit conflicts)\n- No structured decomposition - agents spawn ad-hoc background tasks\n- Coordinator explicitly told to use background_task for all exploration/research\n- Background tasks disabled from spawning more background tasks (vs Swarm allows recursive spawning)","created_at":"1766673403857.0","tags":"oh-my-opencode,background-agents,async,event-driven,opencode-api,task-lifecycle,research"}

Key learnings:\n\n**JSON boolean handling in SQLite/libSQL:** JSON stores booleans as 0/1, not strings. Use `json_extract(data, '$.success') = 0` for false, NOT `= 'false'`. This is because json_extract returns native SQLite types (0 for false, 1 for true), not JSON strings.\n\n**json_each() table aliasing:** When using json_each() in a FROM clause with other tables, ALWAYS alias it and qualify column names. `json_each(events.data, '$.paths') as paths` then use `paths.value`, not `value`. Without aliasing, SQLite throws \"ambiguous column name: type\" because json_each has its own \"type\" column.\n\n**Correct json_each syntax:** Use `json_each(table.column, '$.field')` with the JSON path, NOT `json_each(json_extract(...))`. Direct syntax: `FROM events, json_each(events.data, '$.paths') as paths` then `paths.value` for array elements.\n\n**Time filter parameterization:** For optional time filters, use pattern: `WHERE (? IS NULL OR timestamp >= ?) AND (? IS NULL OR timestamp <= ?)`. Pass same value twice: [sinceMs, sinceMs, untilMs, untilMs]. This allows NULL to skip the filter while still using parameterized queries.\n\n**Test patterns:** Integration tests use `createInMemorySwarmMailLibSQL()`, then `swarmMail.getDatabase()` for raw SQL. Insert test data with `db.query(sql, [params])`, not `db.execute()` (DatabaseAdapter only has query method).\n\n**Four Golden Signals mapping:**\n1. Latency = task duration by strategy (subtask_outcome events)\n2. Traffic = events per hour (time-series bucketing with strftime)\n3. Errors = failed tasks by agent (success=false filter)\n4. Saturation = active reservations (created but not released)\n5.

Key insight: The adapter is a factory function returning an object literal, so retry helper must be a module-level function, not a class method. Write operations that need retry: db.exec() (in resetDatabase), db.checkpoint() (in runMigrations). Pattern: `await withRetry(() => db.operation())`. The wrapper uses Effect.runPromise(withSqliteRetry(Effect.tryPromise(operation))) for exponential backoff (100ms, 200ms, 400ms, max 3 retries). Integration tests confirm concurrent resetDatabase and checkpoint operations don't fail with SQLITE_BUSY.

{"id":"a3983e28-31b0-4ee4-95e5-57ce24988ccb","information":"Implemented 'swarm log sessions' CLI subcommand for viewing captured coordinator sessions.\n\nKEY IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS:\n1. **TDD approach**: Wrote failing tests first in swarm.test.ts, then implemented helpers and CLI command to make them pass. Tests cover: session file parsing, listing with metadata, filtering by type/time, latest session retrieval.\n\n2. **Session file format**: JSONL with CoordinatorEvent objects from eval-capture.ts. Each line is a JSON event with discriminated union on event_type (DECISION/VIOLATION/OUTCOME/COMPACTION). Session files stored in ~/.config/swarm-tools/sessions/{session_id}.jsonl.\n\n3. **CLI structure**: Added logSessions() function called from logs() when first arg is 'sessions'. Follows existing pattern: parseArgs, filter, format, output (text or JSON).\n\n4. **Helper functions**: parseSessionFile (read JSONL, skip invalid lines), listSessionFiles (read all, extract metadata, sort by time), getLatestSession, filterEventsByType, filterEventsSince, formatEvent (colored output by event type).\n\n5. **Features implemented**:\n   - `swarm log sessions` - list all sessions with metadata (start time, event count, duration)\n   - `swarm log sessions <id>` - view specific session (supports partial ID match)\n   - `swarm log sessions --latest` - view most recent session\n   - `--type <TYPE>` - filter by event type (DECISION/VIOLATION/OUTCOME/COMPACTION)\n   - `--since <duration>` - time filter (30s, 5m, 2h, 1d)\n   - `--limit <n>` - limit event count\n   - `--json` - JSON output for piping to jq\n\n6. **Testing gotcha**: Busy wait isn't reliable for ensuring different timestamps. Use explicit baseTimestamp parameter in test helpers instead.\n\n7. **Import pattern**: Must import CoordinatorEvent type from ../src/eval-capture.js for type safety.\n\nCOMPLETES OBSERVABILITY STORY: Session capture (eval-capture.ts) → View (swarm log sessions) → Score (coordinator evals)","created_at":"1766640585732.0","tags":"cli,swarm-log,sessions,observability,tdd,coordinator-events,jsonl"}

Specifically:\n- `messages` table was missing `project_key` column\n- `events` table had wrong schema (aggregate_id/aggregate_type/payload instead of project_key/timestamp/data)\n\n**Why it happened:**\n1. Tables were created by an older version of the code with different schema\n2. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` doesn't update existing tables\n3. `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_messages_project ON messages(project_key)` failed because the column didn't exist\n4. The `schema_version` table was either missing or had incorrect entries\n\n**Debug approach that worked:**\n1. Added `SWARM_DEBUG=1` environment variable check\n2. Added console.error logging at each step of schema initialization\n3. Traced the exact SQL statement that failed\n4. Used `PRAGMA table_info(tablename)` to check actual column structure\n\n**Fix:**\n1. Drop and recreate tables with correct schema (safe if empty)\n2. Or use ALTER TABLE to add missing columns\n3. Ensure schema_version table accurately reflects applied migrations\n4.

The constraint isn't just validation - it's a data integrity rule that requires coordinated updates.\n\n**TDD Test That Caught It:**\n```typescript\ntest(\"changeCellStatus to 'closed' sets closed_at\", async () => {\n  const cell = await adapter.createCell(projectKey, {...});\n  const updated = await adapter.changeCellStatus(projectKey, cell.id, \"closed\");\n  expect(updated.closed_at).toBeGreaterThan(0);  // FAILED before fix\n});\n```\n\n**Related Pattern:** `closeCell()` event handler was ALREADY doing this correctly - it set `status`, `closed_at`, and `closed_reason` together.

Manifest-Driven Generation Pattern (acfs.manifest.yaml):**\n- YAML manifest defines modules with metadata: id, phase, dependencies, install commands, verify commands, installed_check\n- TypeScript generator (packages/manifest/src/generate.ts) compiles YAML → shell scripts (scripts/generated/)\n- Each module becomes an idempotent bash function with skip logic via installed_check\n- `installed_check: { run_as: target_user, command: \"test -x ~/.bun/bin/bun\" }` → skips if already installed\n- verified_installer pattern: delegates to checksummed upstream install scripts, no inline commands needed\n\n**2. State Persistence with Stable IDs (scripts/lib/state.sh):**\n- state.json v2 uses stable phase IDs ([\"user_setup\", \"filesystem\", \"shell_setup\"...]) NOT numbers\n- Why: if phases reorder, resume logic doesn't skip wrong phases\n- Atomic writes: temp file → sync → rename (prevents corruption on crash/disconnect)\n- Tracks completed_phases, current_phase, current_step, phase_durations, failed_phase + error\n- JSON schema versioning for migrations (v2 → v3 added ubuntu_upgrade section)\n\n**3. Checksum-Verified Installers (scripts/lib/security.sh):**\n- checksums.yaml: maps tool names to upstream URL + SHA256\n- fetch_and_run_with_recovery(): fetches, verifies checksum, pipes to runner if match, skips or aborts if mismatch\n- HTTPS enforcement: curl --proto '=https' --proto-redir '=https' (prevents downgrade attacks)\n- Sentinel-based fetching preserves trailing newlines (appends __ACFS_EOF_SENTINEL__, strips after hash)\n- Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient network errors (exit codes 6,7,28,35,52,56)\n\n**4. Contract Validation (scripts/lib/contract.sh):**\n- acfs_require_contract() validates required env vars (TARGET_USER, TARGET_HOME, MODE) and helper functions before generated modules run\n- Prevents runtime errors from missing context\n- Explicit dependencies over implicit coupling\n\n**5. Doctor Checks with Caching + Timeouts (scripts/lib/doctor.sh):**\n- Three-tier checks: binary existence, shallow verification, deep functional tests (--deep flag)\n- Cache successful deep checks for 5min to avoid slow re-runs\n- Per-check timeout (15s default) prevents indefinite hangs, returns special \"timeout\" status\n- JSON output mode for parsing, gum UI for humans\n- Skipped tools tracking from state.json to differentiate \"not installed\" vs \"skipped by user\"\n\n**6. AGENTS.md Destructive Command Controls:**\n- RULE 1: NEVER delete files without explicit approval in same session\n- Forbidden: git reset --hard, git clean -fd, rm -rf without user providing exact command\n- Audit trail required: user text, command run, timestamp\n- Bun-only mandate: no npm/yarn/pnpm, only bun.lock\n\n**7. Generated File Convention:**\n- scripts/generated/ NEVER edited manually (stamped with generator metadata)\n- Modify generator (packages/manifest/src/generate.ts) → regenerate → shellcheck\n- Clear separation: hand-written libs in scripts/lib/, generated modules in scripts/generated/\n\n**Implementation for swarm:**\n- Adopt manifest-driven plugin tool generation (YAML → TypeScript compiler → MCP tools)\n- Use stable IDs for swarm phases/subtasks (not array indices) in decomposition\n- Add checksum verification to skill downloads and external script execution\n- Contract validation for swarm workers (require swarmmail_init, file reservations before work)\n- Doctor-style health checks for swarm coordination (detect stale reservations, blocked agents)\n- AGENTS.md-style mandate for destructive operations (NEVER close cells without completion criteria met)","created_at":"1766590813558.0","tags":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup,manifest-generation,state-persistence,idempotency"}

Drizzle validates schema on instantiation, causing \"table X has no column Y\" errors when tables don't exist.\n\n**Solution:** Create subsystem-specific Drizzle client factories that only load relevant schemas:\n\n```typescript\nfunction getHiveDrizzle(db: DatabaseAdapter) {\n  // Import only hive schema tables\n  const hiveSchema = { beads };\n  \n  // For LibSQL Client, get the client and wrap with Drizzle\n  if (typeof (db as any).getClient === 'function') {\n    const client = (db as any).getClient();\n    return drizzle(client, { schema: hiveSchema });\n  }\n  \n  // For PGlite or raw client, wrap directly\n  return drizzle(db as any, { schema: hiveSchema });\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Tests work with minimal schema setup (only tables needed for subsystem)\n- Faster Drizzle instantiation (fewer tables to validate)\n- Clear separation of concerns (hive code only sees hive schema)\n\n**Pattern:** When migrating subsystems to Drizzle, create `get{Subsystem}Drizzle()` helpers in subsystem-specific files (e.g., `hive/queries-drizzle.ts`, `streams/store-drizzle.ts`).\n\n**Applies to:** swarm-mail hive subsystem, but pattern is universal for any Drizzle migration with multiple schemas.\n","created_at":"1766331998014.0","tags":"drizzle,testing,schema-isolation,subsystem-migration,hive"}

Root cause was missing `dbOverride` parameter in reserveAgentFiles(), releaseAgentFiles(), and initAgent().\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Added `dbOverride?: DatabaseAdapter` to ReserveFilesOptions, ReleaseFilesOptions, and InitAgentOptions interfaces\n2. Updated reserveAgentFiles() to use `const db = dbOverride ?? await getProjectDatabase(projectPath)`\n3. Updated releaseAgentFiles() same pattern\n4. Updated initAgent() same pattern\n5. Prevented closing db connection when dbOverride was provided (test owns the connection)\n6. Updated all 11 tests to create in-memory adapter with createInMemorySwarmMailLibSQL(testId) and pass db to all functions\n\n**Critical fix:** DurableLock should only be acquired for EXCLUSIVE reservations. Non-exclusive reservations should skip lock acquisition entirely. Added `if (exclusive)` guard around DurableLock.acquireLock() calls.\n\n**Test pattern:**\n```typescript\nconst { createInMemorySwarmMailLibSQL } = await import(\"../libsql.convenience\");\nconst testId = `unique-test-id-${Date.now()}`;\nconst swarmMail = await createInMemorySwarmMailLibSQL(testId);\nconst db = await swarmMail.getDatabase();\n\n// Pass db to ALL functions: initAgent, reserveAgentFiles, releaseAgentFiles\nawait initAgent({ projectPath, agentName, dbOverride: db });\nawait reserveAgentFiles({ projectPath, agentName, paths, dbOverride: db });\nawait releaseAgentFiles({ projectPath, agentName, dbOverride: db });\n\nawait swarmMail.close();\n```\n\n**Result:** All 28 tests pass, 0 skip, 0 fail.

Multiple apps share same database with isolated namespaces (e.g., `zER_users`, `zEW_users` in same db).\n\n5. **Consumer Usage Pattern**: Consumer creates pgTable with prefix, calls schema factory, creates db with merged schemas, passes db+tableFn to adapter.\n\nThis enables extracting packages like swarm-mail as pure libraries that integrate into consumer's database rather than owning their own instance.
