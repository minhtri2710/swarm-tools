Compaction Context Injection - preserve decomposition strategy through compaction\n3. Preemptive Compaction - compact at 80% threshold, not 100% overflow\n4. Event + Polling Hybrid - faster completion detection\n5. Parallel Execution Minimums - force 3+ parallel tool calls for researchers\n6. Context-Safe Tool Limits - hard caps on repo-autopsy, cass, find-exports\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**\n7. Todo-Aware Completion - check for unfinished work before marking done\n8. Think Mode Auto-Switching - extended thinking for complex decomposition\n\n### Implementation Phases\n- Phase 1: Delegation Protocol + Context Injection\n- Phase 2: Preemptive Compaction + Event Hybrid\n- Phase 3: Tool Limits + Parallel Enforcement\n- Phase 4: Bonus Features\n\n### Attribution\nAll patterns credited to code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode (2961★)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-25T14:24:21.120Z","updated_at":"2025-12-25T14:43:59.615Z","closed_at":"2025-12-25T14:43:59.615Z","dependencies":[],"labels":[],"comments":[]}
