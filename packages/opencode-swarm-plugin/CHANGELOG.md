# opencode-swarm-plugin

## 0.33.0

### Minor Changes

- [`c41abcf`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/c41abcfa37292b72fe41e0cf9d25c6612ae75fa2) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🎓 Skills Grow Up: Discovery Moves to OpenCode

  > _"The best code is no code at all. Every new line of code you willingly bring into the world is code that has to be debugged, code that has to be read and understood, code that has to be supported."_
  > — Jeff Atwood

  Skills outgrew the nest. OpenCode is shipping native skills support following the [Agent Skills spec](https://spec.agentskills.com/), and our discovery tools are now redundant. Time to deprecate the scaffolding and let the platform handle what it does best.

  ### What Changed

  **Deprecated Tools** (soft deprecation with console warnings):

  - `skills_list` - OpenCode will handle discovery natively
  - `skills_use` - OpenCode will handle loading via `use skill <name>` syntax
  - `skills_read` - OpenCode will handle resource access transparently
  - `skills_execute` - OpenCode will handle script execution in skill context

  **Authoring Tools Kept** (fully functional, no changes):

  - `skills_create` - Create new skills with SKILL.md template
  - `skills_update` - Update existing skill content
  - `skills_init` - Initialize skills directory in projects
  - `skills_add_script` - Add executable scripts to skills
  - `skills_delete` - Remove project skills

  **Bundled Skills** - All 6 global skills remain intact and spec-compliant:

  - `testing-patterns` - Feathers seams + Beck's 4 rules
  - `swarm-coordination` - Multi-agent task orchestration
  - `cli-builder` - Command-line interface patterns
  - `learning-systems` - Confidence decay, pattern maturity
  - `skill-creator` - Meta-skill for authoring new skills
  - `system-design` - Architecture decision frameworks

  ### Why It Matters

  **Before:** Two overlapping skill systems causing confusion. Agents could use plugin tools OR OpenCode's native syntax, with different behavior and semantics.

  **After:** One canonical path. OpenCode owns discovery and loading. Plugin owns authoring and validation. Clean separation of concerns.

  **Benefits:**

  - No tool conflicts between plugin and platform
  - Native OpenCode syntax (`use skill testing-patterns`) works seamlessly
  - Simpler mental model for users
  - Authoring tools remain for creating spec-compliant skills

  ### Migration Path

  **For Discovery/Loading:**

  ```typescript
  // OLD (deprecated, still works but warns)
  skills_list()
  skills_use(name="testing-patterns")

  // NEW (OpenCode native syntax)
  use skill testing-patterns
  use skill cli-builder with "building argument parser"
  ```

  **For Authoring (no change needed):**

  ```typescript
  // Still fully supported
  skills_create((name = "my-skill"), (description = "Domain expertise"));
  skills_update((name = "my-skill"), (content = "Updated SKILL.md"));
  skills_add_script(
    (skill_name = "my-skill"),
    (script_name = "validate.ts"),
    (content = "...")
  );
  ```

  ### Backward Compatibility

  **Yes, with warnings.** Deprecated tools continue to function but emit console warnings directing users to OpenCode's native syntax. No breaking changes in this release.

  Future major version (v1.0) will remove deprecated discovery tools entirely. Authoring tools remain permanent.

  ### What This Means for Bundled Skills

  Nothing changes. All 6 global skills ship with the plugin and are accessible via OpenCode's native `use skill <name>` syntax. They follow the Agent Skills spec and work identically whether loaded via deprecated plugin tools or native OpenCode.

  The `global-skills/` directory remains the canonical source for our curated skill library.

  > "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." — Alan Kay

  Compaction just got smarter. Instead of static "here's what to preserve" instructions, the swarm now **generates dynamic continuation prompts** with actual state data.

  **What changed:**

  The `experimental.session.compacting` hook now uses a three-level fallback chain:

  1. **LLM-Generated Prompt** (NEW) - Queries actual swarm state (cells, epics, subtasks), shells out to `opencode run -m <liteModel>` to generate a structured continuation prompt with real IDs, real status, real next actions
  2. **Static Context** - Falls back to `SWARM_COMPACTION_CONTEXT` if LLM fails
  3. **Detection Fallback** - For low-confidence swarm detection, injects `SWARM_DETECTION_FALLBACK`
  4. **None** - No injection if no swarm evidence

  **Progressive Enhancement:**

  Uses OpenCode PR #5907's new `output.prompt` API when available:

  ```typescript
  if ("prompt" in output) {
    output.prompt = llmGeneratedPrompt; // Replaces entire compaction prompt
  } else {
    output.context.push(llmGeneratedPrompt); // Old API fallback
  }
  ```

  **New interfaces:**

  - `SwarmStateSnapshot` - Structured state for LLM input
  - `querySwarmState()` - Queries cells via swarm CLI
  - `generateCompactionPrompt()` - Shells out to lite model (30s timeout)

  **Why it matters:**

  Before: "Hey, you should preserve swarm state" (agent has to figure out what that means)
  After: "Here's epic bd-xyz with 3/5 subtasks done, bd-xyz.2 is blocked on auth, spawn bd-xyz.4 next"

  The coordinator wakes up from compaction with **concrete data**, not instructions to go find data.

  **Backward compatible:** Falls back gracefully on older OpenCode versions or LLM failures.

- [`652fd16`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/652fd16ff424eff92ebb3f5da0599caf676de2ce) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🔭 Observability Stack MVP: See What Your Swarm Is Doing

  > "You can't improve what you can't measure." — Peter Drucker

  The swarm just got eyes. This release adds comprehensive observability for multi-agent coordination, answering the eternal question: "Why did my epic fail?"

  ### What's New

  **Structured Error Classes** (swarm-mail)

  - `BaseSwarmError` with rich context: agent, bead_id, epic_id, timestamp, recent events
  - Specialized errors: `ReservationError`, `CheckpointError`, `ValidationError`, `DecompositionError`
  - Every error includes actionable suggestions for resolution
  - Full `toJSON()` serialization for logging and debugging

  **DEBUG Logging** (swarm-mail)

  - `DEBUG=swarm:*` environment variable filtering
  - 4 subsystems: `swarm:events`, `swarm:reservations`, `swarm:messages`, `swarm:checkpoints`
  - Zero overhead when disabled

  **swarm-db CLI** (swarm-mail)

  ```bash
  # Raw SQL queries (SELECT only, max 1000 rows)
  swarm-db query "SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM events GROUP BY type"

  # Pre-built analytics
  swarm-db analytics failed-decompositions --since 7d --format json

  # List available analytics
  swarm-db list
  ```

  **10 Pre-built Analytics Queries** (Four Golden Signals mapped)
  | Query | What It Answers |
  |-------|-----------------|
  | `failed-decompositions` | Which strategies are failing? |
  | `strategy-success-rates` | What's working? |
  | `lock-contention` | Where are agents fighting over files? |
  | `agent-activity` | Who's doing what? |
  | `message-latency` | How fast is coordination? |
  | `scope-violations` | Who's touching files they shouldn't? |
  | `task-duration` | How long do tasks take? |
  | `checkpoint-frequency` | Are agents checkpointing enough? |
  | `recovery-success` | Do checkpoints actually help? |
  | `human-feedback` | What are reviewers rejecting? |

  **Agent-Facing Tools** (opencode-swarm-plugin)

  ```typescript
  // Query analytics programmatically
  swarm_analytics({
    query: "failed-decompositions",
    since: "7d",
    format: "summary",
  });

  // Raw SQL for power users (max 50 rows, context-safe)
  swarm_query({ sql: "SELECT * FROM events WHERE type = 'task_blocked'" });

  // Auto-diagnosis for debugging
  swarm_diagnose({
    epic_id: "bd-123",
    include: ["blockers", "errors", "timeline"],
  });

  // Learning insights for feedback loops
  swarm_insights({ scope: "epic", metrics: ["success_rate", "avg_duration"] });
  ```

  ### Why This Matters

  Before: "The swarm failed. No idea why."
  After: "Strategy X failed 80% of the time due to file conflicts. Switching to Y."

  Event sourcing was already 80% of the solution. This release adds the diagnostic views to make that data actionable.

  ### Test Coverage

  - 588 tests passing
  - 1214 assertions
  - Full TDD: every feature started with a failing test

- [`ca9936d`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/ca9936d09b749449ef3c88fd3ec8b937f6ed7c29) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🔬 Research Phase: Docs Before Decomposition

  Swarm coordinators now gather documentation BEFORE breaking down tasks. No more workers fumbling through outdated API assumptions.

  **What's New:**

  - **swarm/researcher agent** - READ-ONLY doc gatherer that discovers tools, reads lockfiles, fetches version-specific docs, and stores findings in semantic-memory
  - **Pre-decomposition research** - Coordinator analyzes task → identifies tech stack → spawns researchers → injects findings into shared_context
  - **On-demand research for workers** - Workers can spawn researchers when hitting unknowns mid-task
  - **`--check-upgrades` flag** - Compare installed vs latest versions from npm registry

  **New Tools:**

  | Tool                     | Purpose                                                     |
  | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `swarm_discover_tools`   | Runtime discovery of available doc tools (MCP, CLI, skills) |
  | `swarm_get_versions`     | Parse lockfiles (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun) for installed versions  |
  | `swarm_spawn_researcher` | Generate researcher prompt for Task tool                    |
  | `swarm_research_phase`   | Manual trigger for research orchestration                   |

  **Architecture:**

  ```
  Coordinator receives task
      ↓
  runResearchPhase(task, projectPath)
      ↓
    extractTechStack() → identify technologies
    discoverDocTools() → find available tools
    getInstalledVersions() → read lockfiles
    Spawn researchers (parallel)
    Collect summaries → shared_context
      ↓
  Normal decomposition with enriched context
  ```

  **Why This Matters:**

  Workers now start with version-specific documentation instead of hallucinating APIs. Researchers store detailed findings in semantic-memory, so future agents don't repeat the research.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`652fd16`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/652fd16ff424eff92ebb3f5da0599caf676de2ce)]:
  - swarm-mail@1.4.0

## 0.32.0

### Minor Changes

- [#54](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/pull/54) [`358e18f`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/358e18f0f7f18d03492ef16c2c1d3edd85c00101) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🔍 Coordinator Review Gate + UBS Removal

  > _"This asynchronous back and forth between submitter and reviewer can add days to the process of getting changes made. Do Code Reviews Promptly!"_
  > — Sam Newman, _Building Microservices_

  Two changes that make swarm coordination tighter:

  ### Coordinator Review Tools

  New tools for coordinators to review worker output before approval:

  ```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │              COORDINATOR REVIEW FLOW                │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │  1. Worker completes → sends completion message     │
  │  2. Coordinator: swarm_review(task_id, files)       │
  │     → Gets diff + epic context + review prompt      │
  │  3. Coordinator reviews against epic goals          │
  │  4. swarm_review_feedback(status, issues)           │
  │     → approved: worker can finalize                 │
  │     → needs_changes: worker gets feedback           │
  │  5. 3-strike rule: 3 rejections = blocked           │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  **New tools:**

  - `swarm_review` - Generate review prompt with epic context + git diff
  - `swarm_review_feedback` - Send approval/rejection with structured issues

  **Updated prompts:**

  - Coordinator prompt now includes review checklist
  - Worker prompt explains the review gate
  - Skills updated with review patterns

  ### UBS Scan Removed from swarm_complete

  The `skip_ubs_scan` parameter is gone. UBS was already disabled in v0.31 for performance - this cleans up the vestigial code.

  **Removed:**

  - `skip_ubs_scan` parameter from schema
  - `ubs_scan` deprecation object from output
  - All UBS-related helper functions
  - ~100 lines of dead code

  **If you need UBS scanning:** Run it manually before commit:

  ```bash
  ubs scan src/
  ```

  ### CLI Improvements

  The `swarm` CLI got smarter:

  - Better error messages for missing dependencies
  - Cleaner output formatting
  - Improved help text

### Patch Changes

- [#54](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/pull/54) [`358e18f`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/358e18f0f7f18d03492ef16c2c1d3edd85c00101) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🧪 Integration Test Coverage: 0% → 95%

  > _"Many characterization tests look like 'sunny day' tests. They don't test many special conditions; they just verify that particular behaviors are present. From their presence, we can infer that refactoring hasn't broken anything."_
  > — Michael Feathers, _Working Effectively with Legacy Code_

  We had a bug that broke ALL swarm tools:

  ```
  Error: [streams/store] dbOverride parameter is required for this function.
  PGlite getDatabase() has been removed.
  ```

  **Why didn't tests catch it?** No integration tests exercised the full tool → store → DB path.

  **Now they do.**

  ```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │              tool-adapter.integration.test.ts                   │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │  20 tests | 75 assertions | 1.3s                                │
  │                                                                 │
  │  ✅ swarmmail_* tools (6 tests)                                 │
  │  ✅ hive_* tools (7 tests)                                      │
  │  ✅ swarm_progress, swarm_status (2 tests)                      │
  │  ✅ swarm_broadcast, swarm_checkpoint (2 tests)                 │
  │  ✅ semantic_memory_store, semantic_memory_find (2 tests)       │
  │  ✅ Smoke test - 9 tools in sequence (1 test)                   │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  ### What's Tested

  Each test calls `tool.execute()` and verifies:

  1. No "dbOverride required" error (the bug symptom)
  2. Tool returns expected structure
  3. Full path works: tool → store → DB → response

  ### The Smoke Test

  Runs 9 tools in sequence to catch interaction bugs:

  ```
  swarmmail_init → hive_create → swarmmail_reserve → swarm_progress
  → semantic_memory_store → semantic_memory_find → swarmmail_send
  → hive_close → swarmmail_release
  ```

  If ANY step throws "dbOverride required", the test fails.

  ### Also Fixed

  - **Auto-adapter creation** in store.ts - functions now auto-create adapters when not provided
  - **Exported `clearAdapterCache()`** for test isolation
  - **Migrated test files** from old `getDatabase()` to adapter pattern

  ### Mandatory Coordinator Review Loop

  Added `COORDINATOR_POST_WORKER_CHECKLIST` constant and `post_completion_instructions` field to `swarm_spawn_subtask`. Coordinators now get explicit instructions to review worker output before spawning the next worker.

  The "dbOverride required" bug **cannot recur undetected**.

## 0.31.7

### Patch Changes

- [`97e89a6`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/97e89a6d944b70f205eeb83eb3f2c55a42f5dc08) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Setup Skips Already-Migrated Memories

  `swarm setup` now detects when semantic memories have already been migrated and skips the migration prompt entirely.

  **Before:** Setup would prompt "Migrate to swarm-mail database?" even when all memories were already migrated, then hang.

  **After:** Setup checks if target database has memories first. If already migrated, shows dim "Already migrated to swarm-mail" and moves on.

  **Changes:**

  - Added `targetHasMemories(targetDb)` function to swarm-mail
  - Updated setup flow to check target before prompting
  - Fixed connection cleanup in all code paths (try/finally pattern)
  - Suppressed internal PGLite NOTICE messages from user output

  **Root cause of hang:** PGLite connection wasn't being closed in all paths, keeping the Node.js event loop alive indefinitely.

- Updated dependencies [[`97e89a6`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/97e89a6d944b70f205eeb83eb3f2c55a42f5dc08)]:

- [`3147d36`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/3147d36cf2355b9cfe461c7dfc3b30675ea36d89) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🚪 Setup Now Exits Cleanly After Migration

  Fixed a process hang where `swarm setup` would complete the migration but never exit.

  **Root cause:** The PGLite connection created for memory migration kept the Node.js event loop alive indefinitely.

  **Fix:** Close the swarmMail connection after migration completes. The connection is scoped to the migration block and not needed afterward.

  ```typescript
  // After migration completes
  await swarmMail.close();
  ```

  **Before:** `swarm setup` hangs after "Migration complete" message
  **After:** Process exits cleanly, returns to shell

## 0.31.5

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`64368aa`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/64368aa6106089346cd2b1324f6235d5c673964b)]:

- Updated dependencies [[`70ff3e0`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/70ff3e054cd1991154f7631ce078798de1076ba8)]:
  - swarm-mail@1.2.0

## 0.31.3

### Patch Changes

- [`fdddd27`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/fdddd27f9c8627f7de2b9f108827c66c7040b049) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Short Hashes Now Welcome

  The WorkerHandoff schema was too strict - it rejected short project names and partial hashes.

  **Before:** Required 3+ hyphen-separated segments (regex nightmare)

  ```
  /^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+){2,}(\.[\w-]+)?$/
  ```

  **After:** Any non-empty string, validated at runtime via `resolvePartialId()`

  Now you can use:

  - Full IDs: `opencode-swarm-monorepo-lf2p4u-mjd4pjujc7e`
  - Short hashes: `mjd4pjujc7e`
  - Partial hashes: `mjd4pjuj`

  The hive tools already had smart ID resolution - we just needed to stop blocking it at the schema level.

## 0.31.2

### Patch Changes

- [`d5ec86e`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/d5ec86e77bdb1cd06cf168946aaaff91208dfac1) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Rebuild with fixed swarm-mail dependency (bigint date fix)

## 0.31.1

### Patch Changes

- [`19995a6`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/19995a68dd1283de1d13afa6fc028bd1273d1b27) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Squashed the BigInt Date Bug

  PGLite returns BIGINT columns as JavaScript `bigint` type. The `Date` constructor throws when given a bigint:

  ```javascript
  new Date(1734628445371n); // TypeError: Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number
  ```

  This caused `Invalid Date` errors in all hive operations (`hive_query`, `hive_create`, etc).

  **Fix:** Wrap timestamps in `Number()` before passing to `Date`:

  ```typescript
  // Before (broken)
  new Date(cell.created_at);

  // After (works with both number and bigint)
  new Date(Number(cell.created_at));
  ```

  **Files fixed:**

  - `swarm-mail/src/hive/jsonl.ts` - JSONL export functions
  - `opencode-swarm-plugin/src/hive.ts` - `formatCellForOutput()`

  **Tests added:** 6 new tests covering bigint date handling edge cases.

- Updated dependencies [[`19995a6`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/19995a68dd1283de1d13afa6fc028bd1273d1b27)]:
  - swarm-mail@1.1.1

## 0.31.0

### Minor Changes

- [`39593d7`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/39593d7ee817c683ad1877af52ad5f2ca140c4e2) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## Smart ID Resolution: Git-Style Partial Hashes for Hive

  ```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  BEFORE: hive_close(id="opencode-swarm-monorepo-lf2p4u-mjcadqq3fb9")  │
  │  AFTER:  hive_close(id="mjcadqq3fb9")                                 │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  Cell IDs got long. Now you can use just the hash portion.

  **What changed:**

  ### swarm-mail

  - Added `resolvePartialId(adapter, partialId)` to resolve partial hashes to full cell IDs
  - Supports exact match, prefix match, suffix match, and substring match
  - Returns helpful error messages for ambiguous matches ("Found 3 cells matching 'abc': ...")
  - 36 new tests covering all resolution scenarios

  ### opencode-swarm-plugin

  - `hive_update`, `hive_close`, `hive_start` now accept partial IDs
  - Resolution happens transparently - full ID returned in response
  - Backward compatible - full IDs still work

  **JSONL Fix (bonus):**

  - `serializeToJSONL()` now adds trailing newline for POSIX compliance
  - Prevents parse errors when appending to existing files

  **Why it matters:**

  - Less typing, fewer copy-paste errors
  - Matches git's partial SHA workflow (muscle memory)
  - Ambiguous matches fail fast with actionable error messages

  ***

  ## Auto-Sync at Key Events

  ```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  hive_create_epic  →  auto-sync         │
  │  swarm_complete    →  auto-sync         │
  │  process.exit      →  safety net sync   │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  Cells no longer get lost when processes exit unexpectedly.

  **What changed:**

  - `hive_create_epic` syncs after creating epic + subtasks (workers can see them immediately)
  - `swarm_complete` syncs before worker exits (completed work persists)
  - `process.on('beforeExit')` hook catches any remaining dirty cells

  **Why it matters:**

  - Spawned workers couldn't see cells created by coordinator (race condition)
  - Worker crashes could lose completed work
  - Now the lazy-write pattern has strategic checkpoints

  ***

  ## Removed Arbitrary Subtask Limits

  ```
  BEFORE: max_subtasks capped at 10 (why tho?)
  AFTER:  no limit - LLM decides based on task complexity
  ```

  **What changed:**

  - Removed `.max(10)` from `swarm_decompose` and `swarm_plan_prompt`
  - `max_subtasks` is now optional with no default
  - Prompt says "as many as needed" instead of "2-10"

  **Why it matters:**

  - Complex epics need more than 10 subtasks
  - Arbitrary limits force awkward decomposition
  - Trust the coordinator to make good decisions

### Patch Changes

- [`08e61ab`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/08e61abd96ced0443a5ac5dca0e8f362ed869075) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Workers Now Choose Their Own Model

  Added intelligent model selection for swarm workers based on task characteristics.

  **What changed:**

  - `swarm setup` now asks for a "lite model" preference (docs/tests/simple edits)
  - New `selectWorkerModel()` function auto-selects based on file types
  - `swarm_spawn_subtask` includes `recommended_model` in metadata
  - `DecomposedSubtask` schema supports optional explicit `model` field

  **Model selection priority:**

  1. Explicit `model` field in subtask (if specified)
  2. File-type inference:
     - All `.md`/`.mdx` files → lite model
     - All `.test.`/`.spec.` files → lite model
  3. Mixed or implementation files → primary model

  **Why it matters:**

  - Cost savings: docs and tests don't need expensive models
  - Faster execution: lite models are snappier for simple tasks
  - Better defaults: right-sized models for each subtask type
  - Still flexible: coordinators can override per-subtask

  **Backward compatible:**

  - Existing workflows continue to work
  - Model selection is transparent to agents
  - Defaults to primary model if lite model not configured

  **Example:**

  ```typescript
  // Subtask with all markdown files
  { files: ["README.md", "docs/guide.mdx"] }
  // → selects lite model (haiku)

  // Subtask with mixed files
  { files: ["src/auth.ts", "README.md"] }
  // → selects primary model (sonnet)

  // Explicit override
  { files: ["complex-refactor.ts"], model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5" }
  // → uses opus as specified
  ```

  The previous release (0.30.3) was published before this fix landed. Now it's actually in.

  **The Bug:**

  ```
  targetDb.query is not a function
  ```

  **Root Cause:**
  `getSwarmMail()` returns `SwarmMailAdapter`, not `DatabaseAdapter`. Need to call `getDatabase()` first.

  **The Fix:**

  ```typescript
  const swarmMail = await getSwarmMail(cwd);
  const targetDb = await swarmMail.getDatabase(cwd);
  ```

## 0.30.3

### Patch Changes

- [`cc84c8f`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/cc84c8f066696c7625dc307a5163ff50d672634e) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Fix Migration Adapter Type Mismatch

  > _"The compiler is your friend. Listen to it."_
  > — Every TypeScript developer, eventually

  Fixed a runtime error in `swarm setup` where the legacy memory migration was receiving a `SwarmMailAdapter` instead of a `DatabaseAdapter`.

  **The Bug:**

  ```
  targetDb.query is not a function
  ```

  **Root Cause:**
  `getSwarmMail()` returns a `SwarmMailAdapter` which has `getDatabase()` method, not a direct `query()` method. The migration code expected a `DatabaseAdapter`.

  **The Fix:**

  ```typescript
  // Before (wrong)
  const targetDb = await getSwarmMail(cwd);

  // After (correct)
  const swarmMail = await getSwarmMail(cwd);
  const targetDb = await swarmMail.getDatabase(cwd);
  ```

  **Test Added:**
  New test case verifies that passing an invalid adapter (without `query()`) fails gracefully with a descriptive error instead of crashing.

  > _"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."_
  > — Leonardo da Vinci

  The semantic memory system has moved into swarm-mail, bringing persistent learning to the hive.

  ### What's New

  **Semantic Memory in swarm-mail:**

  - `createSemanticMemory()` - Initialize memory store with PGLite + Ollama embeddings
  - `getMigrationStatus()` - Check if legacy memory needs migration
  - `migrateLegacyMemory()` - Migrate from old semantic-memory-mcp format
  - Automatic migration on first use (no manual intervention needed)

  **Legacy Migration:**

  - Detects old `~/.semantic-memory/` databases
  - Migrates memories, embeddings, and metadata
  - Preserves all tags and timestamps
  - Creates backup before migration

  **Worker Handoff Protocol:**

  - Agents can now hand off work mid-task
  - State preserved via swarm mail messages
  - Enables long-running tasks across context limits

  ### Breaking Changes

  None - this is additive. The old semantic-memory-mcp still works but is deprecated.

  ### Files Added/Changed

  - `packages/swarm-mail/src/memory/` - New memory subsystem
  - `packages/swarm-mail/src/memory/migrate-legacy.ts` - Migration tooling
  - `packages/opencode-swarm-plugin/bin/swarm.ts` - Uses new exports

- Updated dependencies [[`1e41c9b`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/1e41c9b42ae468761f813d406171d182fb9948e0)]:

## 0.30.1

### Patch Changes

- [`57d5600`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/57d5600a53e148ce1d1da48b3b5a8723a5552e04) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🚦 Review Gate UX Fix + Verbose Setup

  > _"A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools."_
  > — Douglas Adams, _Mostly Harmless_

  Two UX improvements that make swarm coordination feel less like shouting into the void.

  ### What Changed

  **Review Gate Response Fix:**

  - `swarm_complete` no longer returns `success: false` when code review is pending
  - Now returns `success: true` with `status: "pending_review"` or `status: "needs_changes"`
  - **Why it matters**: The old format made review checkpoints look like errors. Agents would retry unnecessarily or report failures when the workflow was actually working as designed. Review gates are a feature, not a bug.

  **Setup Command Verbosity:**

  - Added `p.log.step()` and `p.log.success()` throughout swarm setup
  - Users can now see exactly what's happening: dependency checks, git init, swarm-mail connection
  - **Why it matters**: Silent setup commands feel broken. Explicit progress logs build trust and make debugging easier when setup actually does fail.

  ### Why It Matters

  **For Agents:**

  - No more false-negative responses from review gates
  - Clear workflow state (pending vs. needs changes vs. complete)
  - Reduced retry loops and error noise

  **For Users:**

  - Setup command shows its work (not a black box)
  - Review process is transparent in logs
  - Easier to diagnose when things actually break

  **Backward compatible:** Yes. Existing agents checking for `success: false` will still work, they just won't see false errors anymore.

## 0.30.0

### Minor Changes

- [`f3917ad`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/f3917ad911d3c716a2470a01c66bce3500f644f4) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 The Great bd CLI Purge

  The `bd` CLI is officially dead. Long live HiveAdapter!

  **What changed:**

  ### `swarm init` Command Rewritten

  - No longer shells out to `bd init` or `bd create`
  - Uses `ensureHiveDirectory()` and `getHiveAdapter()` directly
  - Supports `.beads` → `.hive` migration with user prompts
  - Creates cells via HiveAdapter, not CLI

  ### Auto-sync Removed from `index.ts`

  - Removed `void $\`bd sync\`.quiet().nothrow()`after`hive_close`
  - Users should call `hive_sync` explicitly at session end
  - This was a fire-and-forget that could race with other operations

  ### Plugin Template Updated

  - `detectSwarm()` now has confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/NONE)
  - Added `SWARM_DETECTION_FALLBACK` for uncertain cases
  - Compaction hook injects context based on confidence:
    - HIGH/MEDIUM → Full swarm context
    - LOW → Fallback detection prompt
    - NONE → No injection

  ### Error Handling Fixed

  - `execTool()` now handles both string and object error formats
  - Fixes "Tool execution failed" generic error from `swarm_complete`
  - Actual error messages now propagate to the agent

  **Why it matters:**

  - No external CLI dependency for core functionality
  - HiveAdapter is type-safe and testable
  - Plugin works in environments without `bd` installed
  - Better error messages for debugging

  **Migration:** Run `swarm setup` to update your deployed plugin.

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- [`a2ff1f4`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/a2ff1f4257a2e9857f63abe4e9b941a573f44380) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Cell IDs Now Wear Their Project Colors

  > _"We may fantasize about being International Men of Mystery, but our code needs to be mundane and clear. One of the most important parts of clear code is good names."_
  > — Martin Fowler, _Refactoring_

  Cell IDs finally know where they came from. Instead of anonymous `bd-xxx` prefixes,
  new cells proudly display their project name: `swarm-mail-lf2p4u-abc123`.

  ### What Changed

  **swarm-mail:**

  - `generateBeadId()` now reads `package.json` name field from project directory
  - Added `slugifyProjectName()` for safe ID generation (lowercase, special chars → dashes)
  - Falls back to `cell-` prefix if no package.json or no name field

  **opencode-swarm-plugin:**

  - Removed all `bd` CLI usage from `swarm-orchestrate.ts` - now uses HiveAdapter
  - Improved compaction hook swarm detection with confidence levels (high/medium/low)
  - Added fallback detection prompt for uncertain swarm states

  ### Examples

  | Before                  | After                           |
  | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
  | `bd-lf2p4u-mjbneh7mqah` | `swarm-mail-lf2p4u-mjbneh7mqah` |
  | `bd-abc123-xyz`         | `my-cool-app-abc123-xyz`        |
  | (no package.json)       | `cell-abc123-xyz`               |

  ### Why It Matters

  - **Identifiable at a glance** - Know which project a cell belongs to without looking it up
  - **Multi-project workspaces** - Filter/search cells by project prefix
  - **Terminology cleanup** - Removes legacy "bead" (`bd-`) from user-facing IDs

  ### Backward Compatible

  Existing `bd-*` IDs still work fine. No migration needed - only NEW cells get project prefixes.

  ### Compaction: Keeping the Swarm Alive

  > _"Intelligent and structured group dynamics that emerge not from a leader, but from the local interactions of the elements themselves."_
  > — Daniel Shiffman, _The Nature of Code_

  The compaction hook now uses multi-signal detection to keep swarms cooking through context compression:

  - **HIGH confidence:** Active reservations, in_progress cells → full swarm context
  - **MEDIUM confidence:** Open subtasks, unclosed epics → full swarm context
  - **LOW confidence:** Any cells exist → fallback detection prompt

  Philosophy: Err on the side of continuation. A false positive costs context space. A false negative loses the swarm.

  The v7 migration (cellsViewMigration) that creates the `cells` view was added after
  swarm-mail@0.3.0 was published. This caused `hive_sync` to fail with
  "relation cells does not exist" because the JSONL export queries the `cells` view.

  This patch ensures the v7 migration is included in the published package.

  **Socket Server Adapter:**

  - New `createSocketAdapter()` wrapping postgres.js for DatabaseAdapter interface
  - Daemon lifecycle: `startDaemon()`, `stopDaemon()`, `isDaemonRunning()`, `healthCheck()`
  - Auto-start daemon on first use with `SWARM_MAIL_SOCKET=true` env var
  - Graceful fallback to embedded PGLite on failure
  - CLI: `swarm-mail-daemon start|stop|status`

  **$TMPDIR Storage (BREAKING):**

  - Streams now stored in `$TMPDIR/opencode-<project-name>-<hash>/streams`
  - Eliminates git pollution from `.opencode/streams/`
  - Auto-cleaned on reboot (ephemeral coordination state)
  - New exports: `getProjectTempDirName()`, `hashProjectPath()`

  This fixes the multi-agent PGLite corruption issue by having all agents connect to a single pglite-server daemon via PostgreSQL wire protocol.

  **SWARM_COMMAND template:**

  - Added Phase 0: Socratic Planning - asks clarifying questions before decomposing
  - Supports `--fast`, `--auto`, `--confirm-only` flags to skip questions
  - ONE question at a time with concrete options and recommendations

  **Worker agent template:**

  - Reinforces the 9-step survival checklist from SUBTASK_PROMPT_V2
  - Explicitly lists all steps with emphasis on non-negotiables
  - Explains WHY skipping steps causes problems (lost work, conflicts, etc.)

  **Agent path consolidation:**

  - Now creates nested paths: `~/.config/opencode/agent/swarm/worker.md`
  - Matches `Task(subagent_type="swarm/worker")` format
  - Cleans up legacy flat files (`swarm-worker.md`) on reinstall

  To get the new prompts, run `swarm setup` and choose "Reinstall everything".

  **Worker Survival Checklist (9-step mandatory flow):**

  - Workers now follow a strict initialization sequence: swarmmail_init → semantic-memory_find → skills_use → swarmmail_reserve
  - Workers reserve their own files (coordinators no longer reserve on behalf of workers)
  - Auto-checkpoint at 25/50/75% progress milestones
  - Workers store learnings via semantic-memory before completing

  **Socratic Planning:**

  - New `swarm_plan_interactive` tool with 4 modes: socratic (default), fast, auto, confirm-only
  - Default mode asks clarifying questions before decomposition
  - Escape hatches for experienced users: `--fast`, `--auto`, `--confirm-only` flags on /swarm command
