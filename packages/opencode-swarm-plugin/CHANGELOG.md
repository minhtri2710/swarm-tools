## 0.27.3

### Patch Changes

- [`ec23d25`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/ec23d25aeca667c0294a6255fecf11dd7d7fd6b3) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Add .beads → .hive directory migration support

  - Fix migration version collision: beadsMigration now v7, cellsViewMigration now v8 (was conflicting with streams v6)
  - Add `checkBeadsMigrationNeeded()` to detect legacy .beads directories
  - Add `migrateBeadsToHive()` to rename .beads to .hive
  - Add `ensureHiveDirectory()` to create .hive if missing (called by hive_sync)
  - Update hive_sync to ensure .hive directory exists before writing
  - Add migration prompt to `swarm setup` CLI flow

- Updated dependencies [[`ec23d25`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/ec23d25aeca667c0294a6255fecf11dd7d7fd6b3)]:
  - swarm-mail@0.3.3

## 0.27.2

### Patch Changes

- [`50a2bf5`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/50a2bf51c5320c038f202191d7acbfd2179f2cb3) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Fix cells view migration not being applied

  The v7 migration (cellsViewMigration) that creates the `cells` view was added after
  swarm-mail@0.3.0 was published. This caused `hive_sync` to fail with
  "relation cells does not exist" because the JSONL export queries the `cells` view.

  This patch ensures the v7 migration is included in the published package.

- Updated dependencies [[`50a2bf5`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/50a2bf51c5320c038f202191d7acbfd2179f2cb3)]:

### Minor Changes

- [`26fd2ef`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/26fd2ef27562edc39f7db7a9cdbed399a465200d) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Rename beads → hive across the codebase

  - `createBeadsAdapter` → `createHiveAdapter` (old name still exported as alias)
  - `BeadsAdapter` type → `HiveAdapter` type
  - All internal references updated to use hive terminology
  - Backward compatible: old exports still work but are deprecated

- [`ab23071`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/ab23071cc7509c4fc37e1cac0f38a3812022cdf5) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Add swarm-aware compaction hook to keep swarms cooking after context compression

  - New `experimental.session.compacting` hook detects active swarms and injects recovery context
  - `hasSwarmSign()` checks for swarm evidence: in-progress beads, subtasks, unclosed epics
  - Compaction prompt instructs coordinator to immediately resume orchestration
  - Fix @types/node conflicts by pinning to 22.19.3 in root overrides

### Patch Changes

## 0.26.1

### Patch Changes

- [`b2d4a84`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/b2d4a84748cdef4b9dbca7666dd3d313b6cd2b24) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Add automatic JSONL migration for beads on first use

  - Auto-migrate from `.beads/issues.jsonl` when database is empty
  - Fix import to handle missing dependencies/labels/comments arrays
  - Fix closed bead import to satisfy check constraint (status + closed_at)
  - Migrates 500+ historical beads seamlessly on first adapter initialization

- Updated dependencies [[`b2d4a84`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/b2d4a84748cdef4b9dbca7666dd3d313b6cd2b24)]:

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- [`1a7b02f`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/1a7b02f707a1490f14465467c6024331d5064878) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Add PGLite socket server adapter with hybrid daemon management and move streams storage to $TMPDIR.

  **Socket Server Adapter:**

  - New `createSocketAdapter()` wrapping postgres.js for DatabaseAdapter interface
  - Daemon lifecycle: `startDaemon()`, `stopDaemon()`, `isDaemonRunning()`, `healthCheck()`
  - Auto-start daemon on first use with `SWARM_MAIL_SOCKET=true` env var
  - Graceful fallback to embedded PGLite on failure
  - CLI: `swarm-mail-daemon start|stop|status`

  **$TMPDIR Storage (BREAKING):**

  - Streams now stored in `$TMPDIR/opencode-<project-name>-<hash>/streams`
  - Eliminates git pollution from `.opencode/streams/`
  - Auto-cleaned on reboot (ephemeral coordination state)
  - New exports: `getProjectTempDirName()`, `hashProjectPath()`

  This fixes the multi-agent PGLite corruption issue by having all agents connect to a single pglite-server daemon via PostgreSQL wire protocol.

### Patch Changes

- [`7471fd4`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/7471fd43ef9b16b32e503d7cd4bdc5b7a74537e4) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Fix swarm_complete tool execution failures and remove debug logging

  **opencode-swarm-plugin:**

  - Fix: Made sendSwarmMessage non-fatal in swarm_complete - failures no longer cause "Tool execution failed" errors
  - Fix: Added message_sent and message_error fields to swarm_complete response for better error visibility
  - Chore: Removed console.log statements from index.ts, swarm-orchestrate.ts, storage.ts, rate-limiter.ts
  - Test: Added integration tests for swarm_complete error handling

  **swarm-mail:**

  - Chore: Cleaned up debug logging and improved migration handling

- Updated dependencies [[`7471fd4`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/7471fd43ef9b16b32e503d7cd4bdc5b7a74537e4)]:

### Patch Changes

- [`34a2c3a`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/34a2c3a07f036297db449414ef8dbeb7b39721e2) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Grant swarm workers autonomy to file beads against the epic

  Workers can now create bugs, tech debt, and follow-up tasks linked to their parent epic via `parent_id`. Prompt explicitly encourages workers to file issues rather than silently ignoring them.

## 0.25.1

### Patch Changes

- [`757f4a6`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/757f4a690721b3f04a414e4c1694660862504e54) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Fix skills_update tool - add `content` parameter as primary (with `body` as backwards-compat alias)

  The tool was only accepting `body` but users expected `content`. Now both work:

  - `skills_update(name="foo", content="new stuff")` - preferred
  - `skills_update(name="foo", body="new stuff")` - still works for backwards compat

- [`3d619ff`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/3d619ffda78b2e6066491f053e8fad8dac7b5b71) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Fix swarm_complete failing when bead project doesn't match CWD

  - Use `project_key` as working directory for `bd close` command
  - Improved error messages with context-specific recovery steps
  - Added planning guardrails to warn when todowrite is used for parallel work (should use swarm)

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- [`b70ae35`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/b70ae352876515bdfe68511d72bb472c85b7fdfc) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Add Socratic planning phase and improved worker prompts to swarm setup

  **SWARM_COMMAND template:**

  - Added Phase 0: Socratic Planning - asks clarifying questions before decomposing
  - Supports `--fast`, `--auto`, `--confirm-only` flags to skip questions
  - ONE question at a time with concrete options and recommendations

  **Worker agent template:**

  - Reinforces the 9-step survival checklist from SUBTASK_PROMPT_V2
  - Explicitly lists all steps with emphasis on non-negotiables
  - Explains WHY skipping steps causes problems (lost work, conflicts, etc.)

  **Agent path consolidation:**

  - Now creates nested paths: `~/.config/opencode/agent/swarm/worker.md`
  - Matches `Task(subagent_type="swarm/worker")` format
  - Cleans up legacy flat files (`swarm-worker.md`) on reinstall

  To get the new prompts, run `swarm setup` and choose "Reinstall everything".

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- [`434f48f`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/434f48f207c3509f6b924caeb47cd6e019dcc0e1) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Add worker survival checklist and Socratic planning for swarm coordination

  **Worker Survival Checklist (9-step mandatory flow):**

  - Workers now follow a strict initialization sequence: swarmmail_init → semantic-memory_find → skills_use → swarmmail_reserve
  - Workers reserve their own files (coordinators no longer reserve on behalf of workers)
  - Auto-checkpoint at 25/50/75% progress milestones
  - Workers store learnings via semantic-memory before completing

  **Socratic Planning:**

  - New `swarm_plan_interactive` tool with 4 modes: socratic (default), fast, auto, confirm-only
  - Default mode asks clarifying questions before decomposition
  - Escape hatches for experienced users: `--fast`, `--auto`, `--confirm-only` flags on /swarm command

  **Updated Skills:**

  - swarm-coordination skill now documents worker survival patterns and coordinator rules
