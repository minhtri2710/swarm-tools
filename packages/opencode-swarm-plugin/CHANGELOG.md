# opencode-swarm-plugin

## 0.30.5

### Patch Changes

- [`08e61ab`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/08e61abd96ced0443a5ac5dca0e8f362ed869075) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Workers Now Choose Their Own Model

  Added intelligent model selection for swarm workers based on task characteristics.

  **What changed:**

  - `swarm setup` now asks for a "lite model" preference (docs/tests/simple edits)
  - New `selectWorkerModel()` function auto-selects based on file types
  - `swarm_spawn_subtask` includes `recommended_model` in metadata
  - `DecomposedSubtask` schema supports optional explicit `model` field

  **Model selection priority:**

  1. Explicit `model` field in subtask (if specified)
  2. File-type inference:
     - All `.md`/`.mdx` files → lite model
     - All `.test.`/`.spec.` files → lite model
  3. Mixed or implementation files → primary model

  **Why it matters:**

  - Cost savings: docs and tests don't need expensive models
  - Faster execution: lite models are snappier for simple tasks
  - Better defaults: right-sized models for each subtask type
  - Still flexible: coordinators can override per-subtask

  **Backward compatible:**

  - Existing workflows continue to work
  - Model selection is transparent to agents
  - Defaults to primary model if lite model not configured

  **Example:**

  ```typescript
  // Subtask with all markdown files
  { files: ["README.md", "docs/guide.mdx"] }
  // → selects lite model (haiku)

  // Subtask with mixed files
  { files: ["src/auth.ts", "README.md"] }
  // → selects primary model (sonnet)

  // Explicit override
  { files: ["complex-refactor.ts"], model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5" }
  // → uses opus as specified
  ```

  The previous release (0.30.3) was published before this fix landed. Now it's actually in.

  **The Bug:**

  ```
  targetDb.query is not a function
  ```

  **Root Cause:**
  `getSwarmMail()` returns `SwarmMailAdapter`, not `DatabaseAdapter`. Need to call `getDatabase()` first.

  **The Fix:**

  ```typescript
  const swarmMail = await getSwarmMail(cwd);
  const targetDb = await swarmMail.getDatabase(cwd);
  ```

## 0.30.3

### Patch Changes

- [`cc84c8f`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/cc84c8f066696c7625dc307a5163ff50d672634e) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Fix Migration Adapter Type Mismatch

  > _"The compiler is your friend. Listen to it."_
  > — Every TypeScript developer, eventually

  Fixed a runtime error in `swarm setup` where the legacy memory migration was receiving a `SwarmMailAdapter` instead of a `DatabaseAdapter`.

  **The Bug:**

  ```
  targetDb.query is not a function
  ```

  **Root Cause:**
  `getSwarmMail()` returns a `SwarmMailAdapter` which has `getDatabase()` method, not a direct `query()` method. The migration code expected a `DatabaseAdapter`.

  **The Fix:**

  ```typescript
  // Before (wrong)
  const targetDb = await getSwarmMail(cwd);

  // After (correct)
  const swarmMail = await getSwarmMail(cwd);
  const targetDb = await swarmMail.getDatabase(cwd);
  ```

  **Test Added:**
  New test case verifies that passing an invalid adapter (without `query()`) fails gracefully with a descriptive error instead of crashing.

  > _"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."_
  > — Leonardo da Vinci

  The semantic memory system has moved into swarm-mail, bringing persistent learning to the hive.

  ### What's New

  **Semantic Memory in swarm-mail:**

  - `createSemanticMemory()` - Initialize memory store with PGLite + Ollama embeddings
  - `getMigrationStatus()` - Check if legacy memory needs migration
  - `migrateLegacyMemory()` - Migrate from old semantic-memory-mcp format
  - Automatic migration on first use (no manual intervention needed)

  **Legacy Migration:**

  - Detects old `~/.semantic-memory/` databases
  - Migrates memories, embeddings, and metadata
  - Preserves all tags and timestamps
  - Creates backup before migration

  **Worker Handoff Protocol:**

  - Agents can now hand off work mid-task
  - State preserved via swarm mail messages
  - Enables long-running tasks across context limits

  ### Breaking Changes

  None - this is additive. The old semantic-memory-mcp still works but is deprecated.

  ### Files Added/Changed

  - `packages/swarm-mail/src/memory/` - New memory subsystem
  - `packages/swarm-mail/src/memory/migrate-legacy.ts` - Migration tooling
  - `packages/opencode-swarm-plugin/bin/swarm.ts` - Uses new exports

- Updated dependencies [[`1e41c9b`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/1e41c9b42ae468761f813d406171d182fb9948e0)]:
  - swarm-mail@0.5.0

- [`5858148`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/5858148d5785393c0a6993a2595fba275f305707) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - chore: trigger publish workflow

## 0.30.1

### Patch Changes

- [`57d5600`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/57d5600a53e148ce1d1da48b3b5a8723a5552e04) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🚦 Review Gate UX Fix + Verbose Setup

  > _"A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools."_
  > — Douglas Adams, _Mostly Harmless_

  Two UX improvements that make swarm coordination feel less like shouting into the void.

  ### What Changed

  **Review Gate Response Fix:**

  - `swarm_complete` no longer returns `success: false` when code review is pending
  - Now returns `success: true` with `status: "pending_review"` or `status: "needs_changes"`
  - **Why it matters**: The old format made review checkpoints look like errors. Agents would retry unnecessarily or report failures when the workflow was actually working as designed. Review gates are a feature, not a bug.

  **Setup Command Verbosity:**

  - Added `p.log.step()` and `p.log.success()` throughout swarm setup
  - Users can now see exactly what's happening: dependency checks, git init, swarm-mail connection
  - **Why it matters**: Silent setup commands feel broken. Explicit progress logs build trust and make debugging easier when setup actually does fail.

  ### Why It Matters

  **For Agents:**

  - No more false-negative responses from review gates
  - Clear workflow state (pending vs. needs changes vs. complete)
  - Reduced retry loops and error noise

  **For Users:**

  - Setup command shows its work (not a black box)
  - Review process is transparent in logs
  - Easier to diagnose when things actually break

  **Backward compatible:** Yes. Existing agents checking for `success: false` will still work, they just won't see false errors anymore.

## 0.30.0

### Minor Changes

- [`f3917ad`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/f3917ad911d3c716a2470a01c66bce3500f644f4) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 The Great bd CLI Purge

  The `bd` CLI is officially dead. Long live HiveAdapter!

  **What changed:**

  ### `swarm init` Command Rewritten

  - No longer shells out to `bd init` or `bd create`
  - Uses `ensureHiveDirectory()` and `getHiveAdapter()` directly
  - Supports `.beads` → `.hive` migration with user prompts
  - Creates cells via HiveAdapter, not CLI

  ### Auto-sync Removed from `index.ts`

  - Removed `void $\`bd sync\`.quiet().nothrow()`after`hive_close`
  - Users should call `hive_sync` explicitly at session end
  - This was a fire-and-forget that could race with other operations

  ### Plugin Template Updated

  - `detectSwarm()` now has confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/NONE)
  - Added `SWARM_DETECTION_FALLBACK` for uncertain cases
  - Compaction hook injects context based on confidence:
    - HIGH/MEDIUM → Full swarm context
    - LOW → Fallback detection prompt
    - NONE → No injection

  ### Error Handling Fixed

  - `execTool()` now handles both string and object error formats
  - Fixes "Tool execution failed" generic error from `swarm_complete`
  - Actual error messages now propagate to the agent

  **Why it matters:**

  - No external CLI dependency for core functionality
  - HiveAdapter is type-safe and testable
  - Plugin works in environments without `bd` installed
  - Better error messages for debugging

  **Migration:** Run `swarm setup` to update your deployed plugin.

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- [`a2ff1f4`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/a2ff1f4257a2e9857f63abe4e9b941a573f44380) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## 🐝 Cell IDs Now Wear Their Project Colors

  > _"We may fantasize about being International Men of Mystery, but our code needs to be mundane and clear. One of the most important parts of clear code is good names."_
  > — Martin Fowler, _Refactoring_

  Cell IDs finally know where they came from. Instead of anonymous `bd-xxx` prefixes,
  new cells proudly display their project name: `swarm-mail-lf2p4u-abc123`.

  ### What Changed

  **swarm-mail:**

  - `generateBeadId()` now reads `package.json` name field from project directory
  - Added `slugifyProjectName()` for safe ID generation (lowercase, special chars → dashes)
  - Falls back to `cell-` prefix if no package.json or no name field

  **opencode-swarm-plugin:**

  - Removed all `bd` CLI usage from `swarm-orchestrate.ts` - now uses HiveAdapter
  - Improved compaction hook swarm detection with confidence levels (high/medium/low)
  - Added fallback detection prompt for uncertain swarm states

  ### Examples

  | Before                  | After                           |
  | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
  | `bd-lf2p4u-mjbneh7mqah` | `swarm-mail-lf2p4u-mjbneh7mqah` |
  | `bd-abc123-xyz`         | `my-cool-app-abc123-xyz`        |
  | (no package.json)       | `cell-abc123-xyz`               |

  ### Why It Matters

  - **Identifiable at a glance** - Know which project a cell belongs to without looking it up
  - **Multi-project workspaces** - Filter/search cells by project prefix
  - **Terminology cleanup** - Removes legacy "bead" (`bd-`) from user-facing IDs

  ### Backward Compatible

  Existing `bd-*` IDs still work fine. No migration needed - only NEW cells get project prefixes.

  ### Compaction: Keeping the Swarm Alive

  > _"Intelligent and structured group dynamics that emerge not from a leader, but from the local interactions of the elements themselves."_
  > — Daniel Shiffman, _The Nature of Code_

  The compaction hook now uses multi-signal detection to keep swarms cooking through context compression:

  - **HIGH confidence:** Active reservations, in_progress cells → full swarm context
  - **MEDIUM confidence:** Open subtasks, unclosed epics → full swarm context
  - **LOW confidence:** Any cells exist → fallback detection prompt

  Philosophy: Err on the side of continuation. A false positive costs context space. A false negative loses the swarm.

  - Added "Coordinator Role Boundaries" section to /swarm command
  - Coordinators now explicitly forbidden from editing code, running tests, or making "quick fixes"
  - Updated Phase 5 to clarify coordinators NEVER reserve files (workers do)
  - Updated Phase 6 with patterns for both parallel and sequential worker spawning
  - Worker agent template now confirms it was spawned correctly and to report coordinator violations

  - Fix migration version collision: beadsMigration now v7, cellsViewMigration now v8 (was conflicting with streams v6)
  - Add `checkBeadsMigrationNeeded()` to detect legacy .beads directories
  - Add `migrateBeadsToHive()` to rename .beads to .hive
  - Add `ensureHiveDirectory()` to create .hive if missing (called by hive_sync)

- [`50a2bf5`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/50a2bf51c5320c038f202191d7acbfd2179f2cb3) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Fix cells view migration not being applied

  The v7 migration (cellsViewMigration) that creates the `cells` view was added after
  swarm-mail@0.3.0 was published. This caused `hive_sync` to fail with
  "relation cells does not exist" because the JSONL export queries the `cells` view.

  This patch ensures the v7 migration is included in the published package.

- Updated dependencies [[`50a2bf5`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/50a2bf51c5320c038f202191d7acbfd2179f2cb3)]:

  - `createBeadsAdapter` → `createHiveAdapter` (old name still exported as alias)
  - `BeadsAdapter` type → `HiveAdapter` type
  - All internal references updated to use hive terminology
  - Backward compatible: old exports still work but are deprecated

- [`ab23071`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/ab23071cc7509c4fc37e1cac0f38a3812022cdf5) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Add swarm-aware compaction hook to keep swarms cooking after context compression

  - New `experimental.session.compacting` hook detects active swarms and injects recovery context
  - `hasSwarmSign()` checks for swarm evidence: in-progress beads, subtasks, unclosed epics
  - Compaction prompt instructs coordinator to immediately resume orchestration
  - Fix @types/node conflicts by pinning to 22.19.3 in root overrides

  **Socket Server Adapter:**

  - New `createSocketAdapter()` wrapping postgres.js for DatabaseAdapter interface
  - Daemon lifecycle: `startDaemon()`, `stopDaemon()`, `isDaemonRunning()`, `healthCheck()`
  - Auto-start daemon on first use with `SWARM_MAIL_SOCKET=true` env var
  - Graceful fallback to embedded PGLite on failure
  - CLI: `swarm-mail-daemon start|stop|status`

  **$TMPDIR Storage (BREAKING):**

  - Streams now stored in `$TMPDIR/opencode-<project-name>-<hash>/streams`
  - Eliminates git pollution from `.opencode/streams/`
  - Auto-cleaned on reboot (ephemeral coordination state)
  - New exports: `getProjectTempDirName()`, `hashProjectPath()`

  This fixes the multi-agent PGLite corruption issue by having all agents connect to a single pglite-server daemon via PostgreSQL wire protocol.

  **opencode-swarm-plugin:**

  - Fix: Made sendSwarmMessage non-fatal in swarm_complete - failures no longer cause "Tool execution failed" errors
  - Fix: Added message_sent and message_error fields to swarm_complete response for better error visibility
  - Chore: Removed console.log statements from index.ts, swarm-orchestrate.ts, storage.ts, rate-limiter.ts

  **SWARM_COMMAND template:**

  - Added Phase 0: Socratic Planning - asks clarifying questions before decomposing
  - Supports `--fast`, `--auto`, `--confirm-only` flags to skip questions
  - ONE question at a time with concrete options and recommendations

  **Worker agent template:**

  - Reinforces the 9-step survival checklist from SUBTASK_PROMPT_V2
  - Explicitly lists all steps with emphasis on non-negotiables
  - Explains WHY skipping steps causes problems (lost work, conflicts, etc.)

  **Agent path consolidation:**

  - Now creates nested paths: `~/.config/opencode/agent/swarm/worker.md`
  - Matches `Task(subagent_type="swarm/worker")` format
  - Cleans up legacy flat files (`swarm-worker.md`) on reinstall

  To get the new prompts, run `swarm setup` and choose "Reinstall everything".

- [`434f48f`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/434f48f207c3509f6b924caeb47cd6e019dcc0e1) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - Add worker survival checklist and Socratic planning for swarm coordination

  **Worker Survival Checklist (9-step mandatory flow):**

  - Workers now follow a strict initialization sequence: swarmmail_init → semantic-memory_find → skills_use → swarmmail_reserve
  - Workers reserve their own files (coordinators no longer reserve on behalf of workers)
  - Auto-checkpoint at 25/50/75% progress milestones
  - Workers store learnings via semantic-memory before completing

  **Socratic Planning:**

  - New `swarm_plan_interactive` tool with 4 modes: socratic (default), fast, auto, confirm-only
  - Default mode asks clarifying questions before decomposition
  - Escape hatches for experienced users: `--fast`, `--auto`, `--confirm-only` flags on /swarm command

  **Updated Skills:**

  - swarm-coordination skill now documents worker survival patterns and coordinator rules
