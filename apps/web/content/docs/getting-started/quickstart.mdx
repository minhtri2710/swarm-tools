# Quickstart

Get multi-agent coordination running in your project in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- OpenCode CLI installed
- A git repository

## Install the Plugin

```bash
npm install -g opencode-swarm-plugin@latest
```

Or with Bun:

```bash
bun add -g opencode-swarm-plugin@latest
```

## Setup

Run the setup wizard:

```bash
swarm setup
```

This will:
1. Migrate any existing data from previous versions (automatic)
2. Check for required dependencies
3. Configure OpenCode to load the plugin
4. Initialize the hive in your project (if not already)
5. Verify everything works

## Optional: Semantic Memory

For persistent learning across sessions, install Ollama:

```bash
brew install ollama
ollama serve &
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
```

Without Ollama, the plugin still works but falls back to full-text search instead of vector similarity.

## Verify Installation

```bash
swarm doctor
```

Expected output:
```
✓ OpenCode plugin configured
✓ Hive initialized in project
✓ All systems ready
```

## Your First Swarm

In OpenCode, run:

```
/swarm "Add a health check endpoint at /api/health"
```

The plugin will:
1. Analyze the task
2. Decompose into subtasks (if needed)
3. Create cells for tracking
4. Spawn worker agents
5. Coordinate file reservations
6. Report completion

## Manual Workflow

If you prefer step-by-step control:

```typescript
// 1. Check what's ready to work on
hive_ready()

// 2. Start a task
hive_start({ id: "bd-123" })

// 3. Initialize coordination (for multi-agent work)
swarmmail_init({ project_path: "/your/project" })

// 4. Reserve files before editing
swarmmail_reserve({
  paths: ["src/api/**"],
  reason: "bd-123: Health endpoint"
})

// 5. Do your work...

// 6. Complete the task
swarm_complete({
  project_key: "/your/project",
  agent_name: "YourAgent",
  cell_id: "bd-123",
  summary: "Added /api/health endpoint",
  files_touched: ["src/api/health.ts"]
})

// 7. Sync to git (MANDATORY)
hive_sync()
```

## Using Skills

Load domain expertise into your context:

```typescript
// List available skills
skills_list()

// Load a skill for your current task
skills_use({ name: "testing-patterns" })
```

Bundled skills include:
- **testing-patterns** - Dependency breaking, characterization tests
- **swarm-coordination** - Multi-agent orchestration
- **cli-builder** - Building command-line tools
- **system-design** - Architecture decisions

## Key Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `swarm setup` | Initial configuration |
| `swarm doctor` | Check dependencies |
| `swarm init` | Initialize hive in project |
| `swarm config` | Show config paths |

## Key Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `hive_ready()` | Get next unblocked task |
| `hive_sync()` | Sync to git (MANDATORY at session end) |
| `swarmmail_init()` | Initialize coordination |
| `swarmmail_reserve()` | Reserve files for editing |
| `swarm_complete()` | Complete task with cleanup |
| `skills_use()` | Load domain expertise |
| `semantic-memory_store()` | Store learnings for future sessions |
| `semantic-memory_find()` | Search past learnings by meaning |

## Using Semantic Memory

Store learnings for future sessions:

```typescript
// After solving a tricky bug
semantic-memory_store({
  information: "OAuth refresh tokens need 5min buffer before expiry...",
  tags: "auth,tokens,debugging"
})

// Before starting similar work
semantic-memory_find({
  query: "authentication token issues",
  limit: 5
})
```

Memories persist across sessions and are searchable by meaning (vector similarity). See [Semantic Memory](/docs/packages/swarm-mail/memory) for details.

- [OpenCode Plugin Reference](/docs/reference/opencode-plugin) - All 40+ tools documented
- [Philosophy](/docs/getting-started/philosophy) - Design principles and mental models
- [Patterns](/docs/patterns) - Coordination patterns and best practices
- [Swarm Mail Architecture](/docs/packages/swarm-mail) - Event sourcing deep dive
- [Semantic Memory](/docs/packages/swarm-mail/memory) - Persistent agent learning

## Troubleshooting

**"swarmmail_init failed"**
- Ensure you're in a git repository
- Check that `.opencode/` directory is writable

**"Plugin not loading"**
```bash
swarm setup  # Re-run setup
swarm doctor # Check what's missing
```

## Session Checklist

Every session should:

1. **Start**: `hive_ready()` - What's next?
2. **Work**: Use tools, reserve files, communicate
3. **End**: `hive_sync()` + `git push` - Land the plane

The plane is not landed until `git push` succeeds.
